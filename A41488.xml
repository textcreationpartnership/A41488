         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know not how well or wiſely I ſhal mannage my intention in addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my ſelfe in this Dedication unto you:
<pb facs="tcp:60349:3"/> but confident I am, that if a wiſe man had it in hand, you ſhould be no loſer by it. I know you wiſh your ſelfe at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (in affection) from the world, and cloſer, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in your depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on God, and deeper ingaged for Heaven: wherein if this ſmall piece doth you no ſervice, the Author miſcarrieth in the beſt of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne. Neither would
<pb facs="tcp:60349:3"/> the peruſall of it (I conceive) without the proprietie accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, have had the ſame advantage (altogether) of gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon you that way, and winding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſpitit. The ſight of your Name before it, cannot (lightly) but raiſe ſome thought or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion within you, that as God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended you externall comfort in ſpeciall
<pb facs="tcp:60349:4"/> manner, by that part of the world, that outward eſtate, which you call yours: ſo he hath purpoſed ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſupport, and conſolation to you in ſome more peculiar, and remarkable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by thoſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which you may call yours, by a right of propriety, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from all other mens. As it is no part of my meaning to flatter you (a ſinne, as unſavoury to my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb facs="tcp:60349:4"/> as unſutable to my calling) ſo neither would I willingly undervalue, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you in any endowment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured you: yet this I thinke I may be bold to ſay (though I ſtand in much a we of a ſharp &amp; piercing eie which I have more than once obſerved in your underſtanding) that you little thinke or conceive, what ſuch a touch in your
<pb facs="tcp:60349:5"/> ſpirit, or apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as was mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) may advantage you, in reading or ſearching either this, or any other piece of ſpirituall learning. I cannot thinke, but that <hi>Paul's</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Names of the particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and perſons, in the inſcription of his Epiſtles, to whom they were ſent, was ſome helpe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage unto them reſpectively, to reape
<pb facs="tcp:60349:5"/> the ſpirituall things ſowne therein unto them, more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Neither doe I conceive that any of theſe Churches, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the like benefit by any other of the Epiſtles of the ſame Author, as they did by that which was particularly directed unto them: nor yet, that any Church ſince, ever gain'd that meaſure of edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from any one
<pb facs="tcp:60349:6"/> of thoſe Epiſtles, which the Churches themſelves, to whom they were written, gained ſeverally. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I judge the adequate reaſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to lye in this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled and framed by the Holy Ghoſt, with ſpeciall relation and accommodation, to the then preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: but this (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) did alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb facs="tcp:60349:6"/> that they had live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehenſions of Gods intending grace and mercy to them peculiarly by thoſe very writings, which had their Names in their front or inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion, &amp; raiſe, or (at leaſt) quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and confirmed thoſe apprehenſions. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man is touch'd with any ſecret im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, or is able to lay hold on ſuch a
<pb facs="tcp:60349:7"/> hope (whether there be any ſufficient ground for it, or no) that God hath a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe indeed, to come home unto us, and to doe us ſome ſpeciall good by ſuch or ſuch a meanes, as by ſuch a miniſter, ſuch a mans writings, ſuch a booke, or the like, the heart upon ſuch a touch opens more ſweetly and freely, and lies large before ſuch a means tendered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, obſerves and
<pb facs="tcp:60349:7"/> watches things more narrowly, weighs and ponders things more heedfully, and is content and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſtraine it ſelf more than ordinary, to conceive &amp; reach the full importance &amp; tendencie of every thing it meets with: whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when the ſoule is not relieved, and ſtrengthened by ſome ſuch hope or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion as this, the heart is nothing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
<pb facs="tcp:60349:8"/> to the extent and capacitie of it, but lye's ſcant before the meanes, and like a ſayle that is not skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully weathered, loo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeth the beſt part of the benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the gale that bloweth.</p>
            <p>I am tender of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troubleſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: neither ſhall any man, to ſalve the ſeaſons of all your oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and affaires, be more willing to keepe ſilence, than I,

<pb facs="tcp:60349:11"/> my heart is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with thee, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thee part and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with my ſelfe in theſe meditations (if thou pleaſest) and weakeneſſe it muſt be not want of good will, if they leave thee not better than they finde thee: If thou likeſt not to be bound to the occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and trade of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which is the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, I am like to be troubleſome unto thee, and looke for no other, but in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb facs="tcp:60349:11"/> to ſuffer from thee: for I ſhall ſtrive and wraſtle hard with thee, and with much importunitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I give thee any rest or peace, in any contrary courſe or reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. If thou wilt but acknowledge as much concerning thy cenſures, and profeſſe, that if thou miſuſest, or dealeſt hardly with mee in any of my words or intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it ſhall be weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in thee, and no want of good will; I
<pb facs="tcp:60349:12"/> ſhall not goe about to take thy rod from thee: uſe it, and ſmite with it. When love miſtakes, and receives that with the left hand, which was given with the right, the attonement is ſoone made: and friends are eaſily reconciled, when the breach was nothing but miſ-imagination. But to be malice bitten, is dangerous, and very painfull, except a mans fleſh be eaſie of healing, and carrieth a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a cure in it: and
<pb facs="tcp:60349:12"/> the more dangerous it is to be ſo bitten, when the cauſe of the biting, or wound given, is not ſo much a miſtake as a pretence. <hi>Salomon</hi> tels us that <hi>the wrath of a foole is very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, Prov. 27. 3.</hi> the reaſon whereof (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) is becauſe hee wants judgement, and underſtanding to allay and moderate the rage and heate of it, ſo that where it falls, it falls with the whole ſtrength and weight of it. But
<pb facs="tcp:60349:13"/> the wrath of the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is much more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie: becauſe hee uſeth and imployeth reaſon, and underſtanding, to encreaſe and double the rage of it.</p>
            <p>If thou think'ſt that alone, ſufficient matter of cenſure and reproofe, that the world is ſtill peſterd with more bookes (having more already upon the hand of it, than it can tell what to doe with, except it be to complaine of) espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon ſo common

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60349:20"/> duty and ſervice of the day, to remove one ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſtone out of your way, and breake one ſnare in pieces, whereat (it is to be feared) many ſtumble in ſuch occaſions as theſe, and are inſnared.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Therefore briefly you are to conſider, that in theſe duties which wee call faſting and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſelves before God, there is ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of parts and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as was in the Law, (as our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth upon occaſion, to the Scribes &amp; Phariſees) betweene tithing of Mint and Cumin, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of Mercy, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Judgement, theſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60349:20"/> are called <hi>the great things of the Law:</hi> implying that thoſe other were matters of inferiour conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So there are in this duty, in this Great and ſolemne ſervice, ſome thing that ought, and are neceſſary, and fit to be done; others wherein the maine weight, and importance of it ſtands: as Chriſt told the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, that for the tithing of Mint and Cumin, they were things they ought to do, as well as the keeping Mercy and Judgement, though theſe had the preheminence, and were the great things of the Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Thoſe things in this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60349:21"/> duty, which ought not to be left undone (though the life of the duty lyeth not in them) are ſuch as may goe under the name of bodily exerciſe: which I ſhall not need to reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate particularly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as I conceive) they are every mans know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; as namely, faſting, not onely from our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary repaſt, as eating and drinking, but likewiſe from recreations, coſtly apparell, and many other things, wherein the fancie of man is apt to take a delight and refreſhment. And ſo your bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence before God in the aſſembly for a greater ſpace of time than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60349:21"/> To this head, I may referre likewiſe thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions that you uſe to make unto the poore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch occaſions as theſe. Now all theſe are things very fit to be done, but yet you muſt take heed (this is the ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſtone that I ſpeake of, that I would remove,) firſt, that you place no weight at all, or as little as poſſible may be, in the moſt ſtrict and literall obſervation of theſe things, leſt you loſe the crowne of the ſervice, and reward of the day; for ſuch exerciſe profits little (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) except it be (perhaps) to make the ſurface or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60349:22"/> of the ſervice, the more comely, &amp; ſolemne. But now the Mercy, and the Judgement, and the Great things of the Law, the Great things of this day, and ſervice, are the exerciſe of the ſpirits, as firſt the ſummoning, and gathering together into your memories; next a ſerious, and affectuous conſideration, then an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the ſinnes of the nation. So likewiſe a confeſſing (in this ſenſe) of the ſinnes of your owne ſoules, and the ſinnes of thoſe that are under your hand and charge, yea and of the ſins of your fore-fathers; even to the breaking of your
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60349:22"/> hearts, and the humbling and laying low, the ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your ſpirits and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Next to this, your ſerious purpoſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions taken hold of by a faſt and a ſingle hand, of being divorced from all your knowne wayes of your ſeverall ſinnes: not onely your plucking out, and cutting off, but caſting from you alſo your right eyes, and your right hands. This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing that is of the maine body, or rather of the very heart and ſoule of this duty, <hi>viz.</hi> reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and truth of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60349:23"/> Laſtly, your humble requeſts, and earneſt ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, &amp; ſtruglings with God for the pardon of the ſins you have confeſſed as well nationall as perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, the putting forth your ſtrength and might, yea and the encreaſing your ſtrength and might, the provoking your hearts to doe more and more in this kind, in importuning the God of Mercy to powre out of his grace and goodneſſe abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon your perſons, and upon your land, in all manner of expreſſions thereof, which concerne the peace, either of the one or the other. For there is no man, but if he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60349:23"/> hath once ſmitten the rocke of his heart, and gotten out prayers and requeſts unto God, let him ſmite the ſecond time, and the third time, and hee ſhall finde that the waters will ſtill flow more and more. For there is ſpring upon ſpring, de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſire upon deſire. Many rich veines and mines of this treaſure, that might with labour, be digg'd out of the ſoule, &amp;c. And this is the fourth and the laſt thing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Now this is that I deſire to give you in by way of caution, that you charge little of the weight of the day upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer things mentioned, or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60349:24"/> the literall obſervation of them (though never ſo ſtrictly obſerv'd) for there is little of the ſubſtance of the duty in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when you have done your utmoſt; but all the ſtrength and weight, and hope, and power of the ſervice lyes in the latter. And yet I would not have you charge theſe neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their ſtrength, and beyond what they are able to beare: As <hi>Paul</hi> would not have any man to thinke of him above what he either ſaw in him or heard of him, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 6.) that is, above what hee had ſufficient Ground to thinke; and therefore let our thoughts
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60349:24"/> be commenſurable to the nature and qualitie of the things. Thus farre you may build upon them, and thus farre you may truſt unto them, in regard of the teſtimony from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven given unto them. If ſo be they be done with truth of heart, and performed as in the ſight of the God of heaven and earth, you ſhall ſee that light will ariſe out of darkeneſſe unto you, and that the heavens are ready, and doe but waite till the earth calls. Onely you muſt not thinke that the Good, the reward that comes upon thoſe ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is from the merit or deſert of any thing you
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60349:25"/> doe, or from the ſtrength, or worth of grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to goe through ſuch a worke: when you have cauſed your voyce to be heard on high, no you muſt know that all the bleſſing, and the vertue, that ſeeme to come out of ſuch things, even the holieſt duties, in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt manner performed, lyes rather in the ſtrength of the promiſe of God, in that truth and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines him to performe, and make good, all that grace and goodneſſe, that he hath beene pleaſed to ſettle and confirme under the great ſeale of heaven, unto ſuch duties and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60349:25"/> as theſe. (But this by the way onely) now come wee to the words themſelves. <hi>Sanctifie the Lord of Hoſtes himſelfe, and let him be your feare, and let him be your dread, and hee ſhall be a Sanctuary, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, from thoſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60349:30"/> words: <hi>Sanctifie the Lord of Hoſts:</hi> obſerve, that the ſanctifying of God is a ſpeciall duty lying upon the creature.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, from thoſe latter clauſes, let him be your feare, and let him be your dread, obſerve, that there is nothing to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, little or much, but God alone.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, from that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. And hee ſhall be a ſanctuary. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve two things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that God is able to protect in times of greateſt dangers in the middeſt of greateſt evils; otherwiſe hee would not have undertaken the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men in this caſe.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60349:31"/>
                  <p>Secondly, from the connexion of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with the duty of ſanctifying God, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the former verſe, obſerve: That thoſe that will ſanctifie God (or honour God like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for that is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the word ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie, as we ſhall ſee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) in times of danger or greateſt trouble, ſhall have protection from him, ſhall be provided for in peace. This laſt is the point, that I caſt mine eye chiefly upon, for the preſent occaſion, though there be none of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but are worthy our beſt conſideration, and would furniſh us alſo

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60349:32"/> which (I conceive) is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a ſeeking him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that loſſe of him we ſuſtained, by our fall in <hi>Adam.</hi> Firſt, in our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, God was our porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and poſſeſſion: by our ſinne wee loſt him, and knew not how to finde him, or recover him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againe, but God in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, willing to bee found re-injoyed by his creature (in a way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) bids them ſeeke him, that is, ſerve and obey his voyce, and this he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures them, hee doth not require of them in vaine: meaning, that if they would thus ſeeke him, they ſhould finde him, that is, they ſhall recover

And this aboundant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which he intended towards them, if they would ſeeke him (as hee required of them) may well be imployed in the figurative expreſſion here uſed: I ſayd not, ſeek you me in vaine, that is, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not this of you, upon any other termes, nor with any other inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then of your owne unſpeakable and infinite

                  <p n="2">2. Yea it is not onely a truth that God will not ſuffer ſuch ſervices of his creature to goe unrewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as have the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſpirit of ſervices

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Reaſons of this point are;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God will not be ſerved by his creature for nought, becauſe the love that hee beares unto his creature man, being the workemanſhip of his owne hand. I ſhall not neede to prove this love of God to men; the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nay the whole world is full of it, I meane of the ſweet fruits and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it. Yea the truth is, that this ſame roote; The
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60349:36"/> love God beares to the World, beares fruit farre more excellent and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then that wee now ſpeake of, this rewarding men for their ſervice done unto him: ſo that we may eaſily give way in our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to this: <hi>So God loved the world,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Ioh. 3. 16.) that hee gave his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne, &amp;c.</hi> It was a thouſand times more to give ſuch a gift as Ieſus Chriſt was, freely to the world, then to give the greateſt reward under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (yea or in heaven ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to the meaneſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that could be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Love is kind, or
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60349:37"/> bountifull (ſaith <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 4.) that is, is of a communicative nature or diſpoſition. And if this affection out of it's owne nature, propertie, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, otherwiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoked, diſpoſeth to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, or giving gifts, to thoſe that are loved; how much more is this nature and propertie of it ſtrengthned, when thoſe that are loved are alſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, and ſtill ready to obey and fulfill the deſires of the lover. As if a man loves his child becauſe he is his child, how much more doth hee love him, when hee ſerveth him? This is one reaſon of the love of God to man.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:60349:37"/>
                  <p>2. The ſecond reaſon may bee the royall and bountifull diſpoſition in God: It is the peculiar <hi>genius</hi> or ſpirit (as it were) of this diſpoſition, which wee call bountie, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſervices, and that with a liberall and full hand, above the levell (as it were) or nature of them. This bountifulneſſe in God the Scripture often expreſſeth. <hi>David</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the judgements or commandements of God, tells us (to the glory of God in this behalfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 11.) that in keeping of them there is great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. So it was this bountifull diſpoſition in God, that was the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60349:38"/> upon which <hi>Paul</hi> built that high ſaying of his, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 17. For our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh unto us a farre more exceeding eternall weight of glory;</hi> light and momentany af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions could never worke after ſuch a rate of recompence and reward, did they not worke upon the glorious munificence and bountie of God. A manifeſt demonſtration of this diſpoſition in God you may ſee in Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant rewarding of <hi>Abraham</hi> for the obeying his voyce, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 17, 18. This for the ſecond Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Againe, a third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60349:38"/> why God will reward all the ſervices of his creature, may be becauſe he deſires to manifeſt and make knowne both theſe gracious diſpoſitions of his to the world. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſervants both becauſe hee loves them, and is bountifully diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: as likewiſe becauſe he deſires to make a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of both theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties in himſelfe. As a man may build, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath skil in archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, and ſo building is a naturall kind of exerciſe or imployment to him, and in that reſpect, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull: and againe hee may build too, to expreſſe and ſhew the skill and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60349:39"/> ſight hee hath into that art: So God may reward thoſe that ſerve him, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the goodneſſe of his nature, his love and bounty leades him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, in which reſpect it is ſutable and delightfull to him to doe it (though hee had no further end or intent in doing it; partly becauſe hee deſires to make knowne unto his creature, how he is diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both thoſe wayes, both in point of love to his creature, and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of nature alſo. And this diſcovery or manifeſtation of theſe two natures or properties in God, may bee called their perfection, in ſuch a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60349:39"/> ſenſe as Chriſt himſelfe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. ſaith, <hi>that his ſtrength is perfected through weakeneſſe: And Abrahams faith is ſayd to have beene perfected by workes, lames</hi> 2. 22. Any thing that is excellent and glorious, whilſt it is kept ſecret, and remaines inviſible, ſuffers a kind of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and wants ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that belongs unto it, and which would in ſome reſpect, in an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall conſideration, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the condition of it, that is to ſay, diſcovery or manifeſtation. As the Sunne when it is in the eclipſe, or a candle when it is in a darke Lanthorne, or under a Buſhel, though
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60349:40"/> there be nothing internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defective or wanting to them, no more then when the one ſhines in his might, and the other is put on a Candleſticke, yet they are in a kind of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring condition; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inclination or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie in light being, to be ſeene, or to inlighten others. So the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and vertues, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perfections in God; love, bountie, power, woſedome, &amp;c. though they be internally perfect and intire, and wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their perfection (in that kind) whilſt they remaine unknowne and undiſcovered to any but to himſelfe; yet it is a kind
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60349:40"/> of improvement to them, which the Scripture calls a perfection, when they are brought forth into a further light, when the knowledge of them is communicated <hi>ad extra.</hi> For that doubtleſſe is the full and direct meaning of our Saviours words men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: my ſtrength is perfected in weakeneſſe, that is, that abſolute ſtrength and power I have to ſupport my creature, receives perfection, ſuch a perfection, as it is capable of, that is to ſay, diſcovery or manifeſtation, in and through the creatures weakeneſſe. In ſuch caſes it is beſt diſcovered, and conſequently made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,

                     </gap>. The like may be ſayd of all the other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfections in God: their manifeſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is their perfection in this ſenſe; ſo then this may well bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother reaſon of the point, why God ſhould reward the ſervices of his people, <hi>viz.</hi> to manifeſt thoſe two excellent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of his, his love to his creature and the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his nature.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, a fourth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be, the love that God beares to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe or obedience it ſelfe of his creature, the deſire he hath, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light he takes, to have his voyce, and his Lawes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60349:42"/> by men. The Lord takes a pleaſure, and holy contentment to ſee men walking in wayes of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, to ſee their hearts and hands lift up to his Commandements. And becauſe hee would fill the world with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe (if it might be) he would have all the plants, all the vines in his great Vineyard the world, laden with cluſters of theſe Grapes; he therfore ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the hands of men here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, by propounding and promiſing them large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for ſuch works. The Scripture ſpeakes much of this diſpoſition in God alſo, his love to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, his delight in the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60349:43"/> obedience of men. <hi>The righteous Lord loveth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 11. 7.) meaning in men, or in his creatures: and that with a love, <hi>redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dante in perſonam</hi> (as they ſay) that is with a love flowing over, and redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the perſons work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: as it followes in the latter clauſe of the Verſe, <hi>and his countenance beholdeth the juſt,</hi> that is to ſay, with favour and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation; he takes a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to looke upon them, in the wayes of their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe. So 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 22. The Prophet informes us of the ſame diſpoſition in God. <hi>Hath the Lord as great pleaſure in burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60349:43"/> and ſacrifices, as when the voyce of the Lord is obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Behold, to obey, is better then ſacrifice, and to hearken is better then the fat of Rams:</hi> implying, that the Lord takes a holy and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne contentment in the obedience of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for being of a holy and righteous diſpoſition himſelfe, hee cannot but ſympathize &amp; be affected with the ſame wayes and courſes whereſoever hee findes them: as <hi>David</hi> implyed in the words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned: <hi>the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Lord loveth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> intimating that his owne righteous diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the ground or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60349:44"/> to righteouſneſſe in others.

So in procuring obedience fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sunne, Moone, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60349:46"/> Starres, Windes, Seas, &amp;c. (for theſe obey him too, and <hi>fulfill his words</hi> in their courſes, and motions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. 8. he doth not proceed after the ſame method, wherein hee walkes with men, to procure obedience from them, becauſe they are of a different creation, and frame, from theſe: he doth not promiſe rewards to the Sunne, or Moone, or any irrationall creature, to perſwade them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, nor threaten them to keepe them in from diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying, becauſe they have no principle in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, capable of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: but he hath put naturall propenſions into
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60349:46"/> them, which are ſufficient to carry them on in their ordinary and naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, while he is pleaſed to ſupport them, and when hee would have them forſake or ceaſe their naturall motions; as in caſe of miracles, there hee overbeares them with a ſtrong hand of abſolute power, and rules them (as it were) <hi>with a rod of Iron.</hi> But when hee comes to worke obedience out of men, whom hee hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with principles of reaſon, judgement, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, deſires of their owne good, feare of evill, &amp;c. Hee applies himſelfe to theſe in ſuch a manner, that all theſe powers and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60349:47"/> abilities in their natures may be acted and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed withall: which is done by addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto them, in a way of promiſing rewards, if they will obey, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning puniſhments, if they obey not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In this ſenſe, ſpeaking of his manner of dealing with Iſrael of old, to perſwade them to his ſervice, and the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his law, hee ſaith (<hi>Hoſea 11. 4.) Hee drew them with the cords of a man,</hi> that is, hee dealt with them, to make them an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient people unto him, in ſuch a way, and upon ſuch termes, as were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and fitting for men to be dealt withall: imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60349:47"/> that God hath other cords to draw other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures unto him, when hee is pleaſed, and hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to do it.</p>
                  <p>This then is another reaſon for the point, God deales with men for their obedience, and ſervice in a courſe ſutable to the natures and diſpoſitions of men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Sixthly, God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promiſeth rewards, and recompences to the ſervices of men, (and thoſe very ample and large) yea and will aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly performe them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, that ſo he may commend his owne infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite worth and greatneſſe: and give his creature to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60349:48"/> ſee, and underſtand, how highly hee values him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that his creature alſo may ſtrive, and make conſcience to value him accordingly. For this is to be knowne and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the greatneſſe and goodneſſe of God, (which is indeed true greatneſſe) together with his own thoughts or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereof, (which doubtleſſe are according to truth, and commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thereunto) are both to be ſeene, as in a glaſſe, in thoſe rewards, thoſe large and vaſt recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which hee beſtowes upon thoſe that doe him ſervice: as well (if not better) and with more
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60349:48"/> cleerneſſe, than in the horrour and puniſhments of thoſe, that have rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt him, and if he ſhould either not reward at all, or give but ſome low, &amp; common rewards, to ſervices done unto him, he ſhould much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and darken his own infinite worth in the eyes of his creature: wee have a common ſaying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, that there is no ſervice to the ſervice of a King. And ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, the ſervices of men that are greate on earth, eſpecially if they have but that wiſdome, to make the beſt of their outward greatneſſe in a civill and morall way; are
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60349:49"/> better than the ſervices of meaner men. One ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reaſon hereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Kings and Princes, doe not properly give wages, but rewards to their ſervants, that is, in thoſe recompences which they give for ſervice done unto them, they put in the conſideration of their owne greatneſſe, over and above the ſtrict value of the ſervice, ſimply conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in it ſelfe: which is not ſo much a point of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, as of wiſdome in them (though there be a kinde of equity in it too,) for by this meanes they doe informe the world that they are ſenſible of, and underſtand their own
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60349:49"/> greatneſſe, and ſo impoſe a kind of awfulneſſe upon them, and a neceſſitie of conſidering the ſame alſo, ſo the great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth drawes (as it were) the ſimilitude and proportion of his owne excellent greatneſſe, in thoſe great rewards hee gives to thoſe that ſerve him: and withall makes it knowne to the world, that hee underſtands him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the utmoſt: and ſo raiſeth ſutable appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of himſelfe, in the mindes both of men and Angels.

And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (I conceive) why though God loves righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and obedience in his creature (as was touch'd before) yet hee doth not love them ſo much ſimply for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor for that ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and agreement they have with his owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and holineſſe,

                  <p n="3">3 Seventhly (and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) another reaſon of the point may be, to leave the rebellious and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient without excuſe.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60349:55"/> them, in their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>now wee know</hi> (ſaith <hi>S.

For God is ſeldome judged, or queſtioned, but about his proceedings againſt ſinfull, and diſobedient
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60349:55"/> men: and beſides it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that hee ſpeakes of this particular in this place: now God will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for victory in this kinde: hee will cut off from wicked men, and from all thoſe that ſhall riſe up to plead for them, all matter of defence, apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, or excuſe, that might be pleaded for them. And hee ſo much eſteemeth this full, and intire juſtification of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wicked, that hee highly reſpects any ſervice or meanes uſed by men, tending thereunto: upon this ground it was that <hi>Paul</hi> concluded for

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60349:56"/> without excuſe: ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt diverſe other meanes and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that God in his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath belayed for this end, to leave wicked men naked to judgement, and without excuſe, this particular we ſpeake of, is one, his promiſing ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to thoſe that ſhall obey him. If he had been a hard maſter, and would have had the ſervice and labour of men for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, this had beene a colourable pretence for ſuch men, why they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed his ſervice, (as was proved before out of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> 2. 31.)

God hath not ſaid unto you, this day ſerve mee for nought, nor gathered you toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to ſeeke his face in vaine. This for the firſt point of inſtruction.

Hath god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe the promiſes both of this life, and of that which is to come, and May it not regard them? may it not touch, nor taſt, nor handle them? May it not live, and ſtrengthen it ſelfe by the hope of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying them? Hath God planted ſo many trees, ſo many pretious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in the paradiſe of the Scriptures, and is it not lawfull to eate of any of them? Hope muſt be no longer a grace, but a ſinne, if it be not lawfull both to looke at, and to looke for the good things that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60349:70"/> God hath promiſed to thoſe that love him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 It is true, that God is, (as the Father expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it) <hi>ſine intuitu praemii diligendus,</hi> to be loved (and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently ſerved) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any eye to a reward: that is, though he gave no reward to his ſervants, yet for his owne ſake hee were to be loved (and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved accordingly) yet now hee is much more to be loved, and much rather to bee ſerved, now hee doth reward ſo abundantly: And therefore it is not a thing onely lawfull, but neceſſary alſo, yea a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of duty and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to ſerve him for his rewards, at leaſt to ſerve
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60349:70"/> him more, and more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and cheerfully. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wee muſt hold, and maintaine, that God is never the more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, nor to be loved, or ſerved for all his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, how great and preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoever they be: wee are in never the more bonds or ingagement at all unto him for theſe: which is a conceipt, that both reaſon, and religion alike abhorre.</p>
                  <p>The beſt (indeed) and moſt ſpirituall uſe that can and ought to be made of the promiſes, and large recompences which God gives unto thoſe that ſerve him, is, to uſe them as glaſſes, wherein to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template

This, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelfe (I conceive) intimates unto us, in the frequent expreſſion, of ſeeking the face of God. 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 11. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: meaning by the face of God, ſome favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable or gratious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60349:72"/> and Commandements, that hee that deſpiſeth them, deſpiſeth not man, but God, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 8. And if it were not a thing lawfull to provoke, and ſtirre up our ſelves to ſeek God by conſideration, and hope of his mercy, and goodneſſe to be ſhewne unto us, according to the exigencie of our neceſſities, eſtates, and conditions: why do wee keepe theſe dayes of more ſolemne addreſſements, and deepe humiliations unto him? or why have the children and ſervants of God kept them before us?</p>
                  <p>8 It is evident from Scripture, that the hope
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60349:72"/> and conſideration of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining mercy from God anſwerable to their feares, and deſires, and preſent exigences of their affaires, have ſtill been the ground of all thoſe more ſerious ſeekings of God, whether by prayer &amp; crying onely, or by faſting alſo (the chiefe wherof, were brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned unto you) If they had beene foule, and ſinned in ſo maine a circumſtance, as the ground and foundation of their ſervice, would God have ſealed his approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and acceptation of them from heaven, with ſuch gratious anſwers to their deſires, as hee did from time to time? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60349:73"/> wee may be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and eſtabliſhed in this point: that wee ſinne not at all, but approve our ſelves unto God in his owne way, by exciting and quickning our ſelves to ſeeke his face this day, by a hope and confident expectation of finding fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in his eyes, in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering us out of the hand of all our feares, in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away his judgements fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us, &amp; from our nation.

                  <p n="3">3 It may be you thinke (at leaſt many of you, that are of weaker, and looſer conſideration) that you have your full load upon you, all things are as bad with you, as they can be, that there is ſcarce any roome or place left in the body of the ſtate or land, to have any new wound given it: that you cannot be in worſe caſe than you are. A laſſe (as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith to the Jewes, <hi>Mat. 22. 29.) you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</hi> As there is no fire
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60349:78"/> or burning ſo vehement, or great, but by the laying on of dry wood, or caſting oyle upon the flames, will make it greater: ſo there is no affliction, no judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no calamitie, ſo grievous, or ſo heavie, and terrible upon a nation, or people, but the iniquitie and ſinne of the nation ſtill continuing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, the judgements of it may be yet increaſed ſeven fold (at leaſt.) God is able to hold out as long in expending of plagues, and vengeance, upon the children of diſobedience, and rebellion, as hee is to hold out in mercie and goodneſſe to thoſe that ſerve him and obey him,

                  <p n="4">4 For that hath beene Gods conſtant method in proceeding againſt a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or people, to begin with rods, to goe on with ſcorpions, and to make an end with lyons, that teare all in pieces, and devoure: except he be met withall in the way of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with repentance, and teares: deſtruction, ſtill riſing, and ripening, and coming on towards perfection, as the corne doth to the harveſt, firſt the blade, then the eare, and laſtly the full corne in the eare. The impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie, and ſtubbernneſſe of a people, deſpoyles the father of mercies, and

                  <p n="5">5 Secondly by way of Reproofe (more briefly)
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60349:82"/> If God be ſo gratious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that ſerve him, and will not be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for nought: then are thoſe likewiſe children of reproofe, who though they do not wholely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, or neglect this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, yet they are afraid of being burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and overcharged with it: they will binde it to it's good behaviour, that it muſt not wrong, or hurt them, neither in their bed, nor in their buſhell, I meane neither in their eaſe nor pleaſures, nor in their buſineſſe and profits. We have many like poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſes, who will runne their ſtage lively enough, and with good mettall
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60349:82"/> and ſpeed: but it is death to them, to goe never ſo little further: ſo is there a generation both of men and women amongſt us, who can with ſome tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable patience and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion goe along with the miniſter of God ſpeaking the Oracles of heaven, whileſt the glaſſe is run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but if hee carrieth them a little further, though the great things of their owne peace be never ſo earneſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant with them; yet (a laſſe) they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no longer: they now begin to ſweate, and to faint, and ſometimes to neſtle this way, and that; as if their ſeats by

                  <p n="6">6 To men of thus low and ſtraitned ſpirits in the ſervice of God, I ſhall onely ſay this (for the preſent) that if God gave Rewards for his ſervice, by neeked ſcant meaſure, if hee gave ſo many hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens of an houre long apiece, as wee heare ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons whilſt wee live, this were ſome tolerable ground for men to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and ſuffer their hearts in ſuch an humour: but

                  <p>FIftly (and laſtly) for exhortation: If this be the grace and bounty of the great God of Heaven and Earth, that hee will not be ſerved by his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for nought, but hath both purpoſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to recompence all ſervices, and whatſoever good thing any man doth, ſevenfold into our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes; let us all be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted and perſwaded from hence, without any conſultations had with fleſh and blood about

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the worke of God, be an abomination unto us, &amp; let all our right hands forget their cunning when ever they ſhall offer to lift up themſelves unto it: and as for that maſter, to whom we gave our ſelves, indeed, as ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to obey in the dayes of ignorance, I meane unrighteouſnes, or ſin <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. let us breake his yoke from about our neckes, and caſt his cords

                  <p>But leſt this may ſeeme a hard ſaying to fleſh and blood, to men that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have knowne God, nor what his ſervice mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth (being the men, whoſe peace in ſpeciall manner wee labour and travaile with in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation) to be called off from the eaſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

                  <p>Firſt therefore let ſuch men conſider, that hee
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60349:90"/> whoſe ſervice is now ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and recommended unto them, is the great, and excellent and mighty Iehovah, the glorious poſſeſſor of Heaven and earth, who hath the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for his throne, and the earth his footſtoole, <hi>Who is attended by thouſand thouſands of Angels, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtand and miniſter unto him, Dan. 7. 10. to whom the nations are as the drop of a Bucket, and the inhabitants of the earth as Graſhoppers, and are counted as the ſmall duſt of the ballance, Eſa. 40. Who is terrible to the Kings of the earth, Pſal. 76. 12. and bringeth Princes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and maketh the Iudges
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60349:91"/> of the earth, as vanitie, Eſa.</hi> 40. 23. In a word: hee is that God, of the treaſures of whoſe wiſdome, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, power, glory, maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie there is no end, nor ever ſhall be: he is a God from everlaſting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. If the greatneſſe of a maſter be any recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the ſervice, if to powre water on hands that are honorable, be an imployment of higher ſatisfaction to the minds of men, then on thoſe that are meaner, if atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon majeſtie and greatneſſe, bee rather wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges then worth, honour then ſervice; then hath the ſervice of the God of Heaven the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60349:91"/> and no other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, no other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice whatſoever to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired in compariſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; becauſe his throne ruleth over all, he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly exalted above all Gods. They are a paire of ſayings amongſt us, which are too ſtrong in reaſon and truth to bee gaine-ſaid: that there is no fiſhing, to fiſhing in the Sea: no ſervice, to the ſervice of a King: and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> deſirous to advance diligence and careſulneſſe in buſineſſe, all he could; had no greater incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no price or crowne of greater value to hold faith unto it then this; that it would be their prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60349:92"/> to the ſervice of Kings. Seeſt thou a man that is diligent in his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe? he ſhall ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Kings: hee ſhall not ſtand before meane men, <hi>Prover.</hi> 22. 29.

                  <p>Secondly, this ſervice of God, whereunto wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and perſwade, is due debt from his creature: all reaſon equitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſtand up to plead the right &amp; title of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60349:92"/> hereunto. Firſt the law of our creation or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſetleth this tribute we ſpeake of upon God. He that is Alpha by will and good pleaſure, is Omega by right &amp; conſcience: the beginning of a thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be the end of it. Give her of the fruit of her owne hands (is <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> plea on the behalfe of his vertuous woman, <hi>Prov. 31. 31.) and let her owne works praiſe her in the gates. Who planteth a Vineyard</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) and eateth not of the fruit thereof?</hi> Hee ſpeaketh this, not ſo much <hi>de facto,</hi> as <hi>de jure,</hi> not as a matter which ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply men did, but as that which they did very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60349:93"/> no man taking the leaſt offence at them for ſo doing. The ſcope like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the place, cleerely evinceth this to bee the meaning; which is to ſhew, not that Miniſters of the Goſpell did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but that lawfully they might receive and looke for maintenance, from their labour therein. If mens labour or charge in planting, give them a right to eate what they pleaſe, of the fruit of the trees planted by them: much more is the gift of ſubſiſtence and being from God, a lawfull ground unto him, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring any ſervice from his creature, ſutable to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60349:93"/> the being received from him. And <hi>David</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly labours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the cauſe of the worſhip and ſervice of God, both in his owne conſcience &amp; other mens, by the equitie of the ſame conſideration. <hi>Come, let us worſhip and fall downe, and kneele before the Lord our Maker, (Pſal.</hi> 95. 6.) As if he ſhould have ſaid: if we acknowledge God to bee our maker, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing, no ſtanding out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the law of protection, and ſecond the Law of Creation, and joynes hand in hand with it to maintaine Gods right to the creatures ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60349:94"/> He that ſaves a mans life, having a lawfull pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to take it away, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſeth to himſelfe a juſt title to the beſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof. Now God (wee know) is the great and gracious, and mighty protector of the world: hee defends the whole earth with his loving kindneſſe, as it were with a ſhield. <hi>What ſhall I doe unto thee, O thou preſerver of men?</hi> ſaith <hi>Iob</hi> unto God, <hi>Iob 7. 20. In him</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) that is, by or through him, <hi>we live, &amp; move, and have our being, viz.</hi> continued and made good unto us, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 28. And Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. is ſaid to carry, or beare up
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60349:94"/> all things by his mighty Word: as if there were nothing, that could either goe or ſtand alone, or as if the whole creation were ready to ſinke rightdowne into nothing. If Chriſt ſhould let goe his hold, but a moment. And yet wee know wee are all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to him: and long ſince put a ſword in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand, wherewith he might juſtly have ſlaine us at once. He that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecteth us upon theſe termes, doth he gather in proportion, above what he ſcatters, if hee receive ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and obedience from us?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the law of Preſervation, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60349:95"/> ſtrengthens his title hereunto yet further. <hi>Who feedeth a flocke, and eateth not of the milke of the flock?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. Support and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance are ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, and cry out of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and wrong, if ſervice be denyed them. <hi>Becauſe wee have maintenance from the Kings Palace, it was not meete that wee ſhould ſee the Kings diſhonour: therefore have wee ſent and certified the King:</hi> was a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though in bad men. <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 14. It is the brand of the child of perdition, to have eate of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours bread, and yet lift up his heele againſt him: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. Well then, God
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60349:95"/> being the great Foſter Father of the World, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all our hearts daily with food and gladneſſe, he, who opening his hand, ſatisfieth the deſire of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very living thing (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 16. and putteth the ſtaffe of bread into the hand of all fleſh, giving it ſtrength likewiſe to ſupport them: How ſhall we deſpiſe ſuch a great and ſolemne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement as this? How ſhall wee breake, or caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſuch golden cords as theſe from us? that is, how ſhall wee refuſe to ſerve him? <hi>The Saints indeed ſhall judge the World: (1. Corinth.</hi> 6. 2.) but the oxe, and the aſſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60349:96"/> ſhall judge and condemne us, if wee know our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters crib no better.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Law of Redemption triumpheth yet above all thereſt, in the vindication of Gods right and title to the beſt of our ſtrength in his ſervice. And as himſelfe teacheth us to reaſon for our ſelfe, on the one hand: <hi>Hee who ſpared not his owne Son, but gave him for us all to death, how ſhal he not with him give us all things?</hi> So on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand this love of his to us, ſo richly manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the death of his ſonne for us, teacheth us to reaſon againſt our ſelf, (and yet not againſt our ſelfe neither, if wee knew
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60349:96"/> the things of our peace and glory) for him. He who ſpared not his owne Sonne, but gave him for us all to death, how ſhall he not for ſuch a guift ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and looke for all things from us, yea, how ſhall wee not for ſuch a gift prevent his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on herein (if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) and even give him all things, though hee looked for nothing. To diſpute the intereſt God hath in us, or to demurre upon his ſervice, is to ſet abroach a new queree in the world, and to aske for whom Chriſt died? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Angels, or for the ſeede of <hi>Abraham?</hi> Hee that is out of Gods work,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60349:97"/> and deſpiſeth his wayes, and glory, ſeemes willing to comfort the Devills, and to poſſeſſe them with a hope, that it was the Captivity of hell, and not of the world, that was turned by the death of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. There is no withſtanding, no riſing up againſt the Majeſtical power, and authority of this law: it leaves a man nothing of himſelfe, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoyleth him of all right and power of living to himſelfe, and ſeeking his owne things; it ſeizeth upon all his heart, and all his ſoule, and all his minde, and all his ſtrength, upon all that he is, and all that hee hath,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60349:97"/> and all that hee is able to doe, for the uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the great God of heaven and earth: and all this it doth by a ſtrong and high hand of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and equitie. So that there is no man that acknowledgeth his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption wrought, his ranſome paid by Jeſus Chriſt, can murmur or complaine in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that hee is ſerved neither better nor worſe (as wee ſay) then thus, to be caught up out of himſelfe, and from the earth, and by a holy vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence conſtrained, and compelled to ſerve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and to attend the throne of heaven, and to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60349:98"/> live unto him that ſitteth and reigneth thereon for evermore. Redemption by Chriſt, is, as the moſt gratious Law-giver in one kinde, ſo the moſt ſevere in another, that ever was: God himſelfe never gave Law, that reach't ſo farre, or ſo deepe into his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Other lawes and commandements of God it ſhooke off from it ſelf, and deſpiſed, and yet God was able to beare it, and to over-rule and keepe backe his fire and brimſtone, that they brake not out, to take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the tranſgreſſours: yea notwithſtanding the contempt, and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his creature to that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60349:98"/> Law, yet hee lov'd it ſtill; yea with ſuch a love, that travailed with no leſſe birth, than the gift of his onely begotten ſonne Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, for the comfort, peace, and bleſſedneſſe of it. But the Law of that ſervice which the gift of Chriſt and Redemption by him, impoſeth upon man, is indiſpenſable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that knowes no mitigation, or compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: all the grace, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, mercy, compaſſion, bounty, patience, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferance in God, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looke after, never think the leaſt thought of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the leaſt proviſion for the peace or ſafety of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60349:99"/> him, that ſhall live and die in diſobedience to it. There is no bit or bridle that will ever be put in the jawes of hell, to keepe it from falling upon ſuch a man: nay hell will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to cry to heaven for more fire, and brimſtone, (if it were poſſible) to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the torment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſuch a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly (and laſtly,) the Law of inſtruction, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth alſo to do ſervice to the God of heaven, in this kinde, and further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth his creature, man, to ſerve him. <hi>Teach mee (O Lord) the way of thy ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes: and I will keepe it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end. Pſalm.</hi> 119. 33.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60349:99"/> 
                     <hi>David</hi> thought it was but reaſon, to covenant with God, to give him practiſe, for knowledge, ſervice, for teaching. Yea, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who is farre from overvaluing any gift or grace vouchſafed to his creature, nor ever chargeth any commodity of his, wherein hee deales with the world, with any hard, or unreaſonable impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath yet put ſuch an eſtimate or rate upon knowledge, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receives it, muſt either render ſervice, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon it, or elſe ſuffer puniſhment above his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. Therefore ſervice to God, is a rent charge naturally due, and iſſuing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60349:100"/> out of an eſtate of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to whomſoever it is given. <hi>The ſervant that knew his Maſters will, and prepared not himſelfe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many stripes. But hee that knew it not, and yet did commit things worthy of ſtripes, ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes, &amp;c. Luk.</hi> 12. 47, 48. with what ſeveritie of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure did God proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe heathen, that withheld the truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe? <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18. and that eſpecially, becauſe, <hi>that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, &amp;c. verſ.</hi> 21. that is, (in effect) they did not ſerve him. And
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60349:100"/> 
                     <hi>David</hi> propounds it, as a matter of the greateſt and moſt apparent equitie &amp; which the conſciences of all men cannot but ſee and acknowledge, that God who teacheth men know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſhould chaſtiſe and correct, namely when thoſe that are taught knowledge, refuſe to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſervice and obedience, as a dutie or tribute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing thereunto, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 10. upon which place the Chaldee Paraphraſe hath theſe words: Is it poſſible, that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Law to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and they not be rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked when they ſinne? So that this ſervice of God, whereunto you are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60349:101"/> is nothing but what is due unto him, by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of Titles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements from you: you muſt trample under foot, right upon right, reaſon upon reaſon, equitie upon equitie, and turne head up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all conſcience, if you will ſtand out, and rebell againſt the voyce of this exhortation. And know this, that if you will break all their golden Cords by which God hath tyed and bound you ſo faſt to himſelfe and his ſervice, and caſt them from you; God will gather them up from your hand, and turne them into Scorpions, and make a terrible ſcourge of them, it may be for your
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60349:101"/> conſciences by the way, but moſt aſſuredly, for your ſoules in hell. Every reaſon that pleads for the ſervice of God at your hands in this world, will pleade for vengeance againſt you at the hand of God, in that which is to come, if it bee deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to make the neceſſitie of your ſerving God more weightie and prevalent upon you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that as it is his right, ſo it is his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement alſo, to be ſerved by you. Hee hath declared, and teſtified from heaven, that hee is fully purpoſed to ſtand upon his right in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60349:102"/> that hee lookes for the hearts and hands of all fleſh to be lift up unto his Commandements. <hi>Serve the Lord with feare, and rejoyce with trembling. Pſalm.</hi> 2. 11. Hee doth not ſimply command ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of men, but is very choyce of the ſervice hee commands: it muſt be made ſavory, and ſuch as his ſoule loveth: it muſt be prepared for him with that ſpirituall compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of feare and joy. So againe, <hi>Pſalm. 100. 2. Serve the Lord with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Beſides other paſſages in Scripture of like importance, and charge, without number. now then let it be ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60349:102"/> thought of, and laid to our hearts, as hot (or hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) than they can well endure it, of what high concernment it is to the creature, both on the right hand, and on the left, that the voyce, and commandement of God be obeyed, <hi>Mallem obedire, quam miracula facere, etiam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi poſſem:</hi> I had rather o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, than worke miracles, though I could, was a ſtraine of that wiſdome, which God gave unto his ſervant <hi>Luther.</hi> The truth is, that obedience it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than a being in heaven ſimply: becauſe without obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, a being in heaven would ſoone be turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a being in hell (a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60349:103"/> ratified by the fall of Angels) whereas on the contrary, a being in hell, would ſoone be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a being in heaven, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience be found with it (a concluſion gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſealed by the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, and his aſcention into glory, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in hell, nor ſuffer thy Holy One to ſee corruption. Act. 2. 27. Hath the Lord as great pleaſure in burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and ſacrifices, as when the voyce of the Lord is obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> ſaith <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul, 1 Sam.</hi> 15. 22. So that he that obeyeth the voyce of God, pleaſeth him: and he that pleaſeth God is a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60349:103"/> benefactour to many, and pleaſures the world round about him. God is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome pleaſed, but the windowes of heaven are preſently opened, and the bleſſings thereof powred downe upon the Earth. But oh! who is able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the heate of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation when he comes to avenge the words of his mouth, upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient and rebellious? What is it that puts the foundations of the world out of their courſe? that makes Kings and Princes to labour in the very fire? What is it that teares up the mountaines by the rootes, and carries them into the midſt of the Sea?
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60349:104"/> What is it that ſhakes ſo terribly the Earth, as it is at this day, nation being riſen againſt nation, and Kingdome againſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? What is it that cauſeth the Sunne to be darkned, and the Moone to be turned into blood, and the Starres to fall out of heaven, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of heaven themſelves to be ſhaken, that is (as ſome interpret) the holy Angels with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the great terrour of the Almighty falling on the earth? In a word: What is that ſeparates betweene the world, and the peace of it, having the God of Peace for its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour and Ruler, that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60349:104"/> turnes the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and the God of all comfort, into a conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire to it, but onely the neglect and contempt of this great commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the moſt High: He commands the world to ſerve him: and the world would make him ſerve with her ſinnes: and this is that, that the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of him, whoſe name is jealous cannot beare. Thus the great breach is made upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, &amp; the whole world (in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) caſt upon the bed of ſorrow: yea, from the wombe of the contempt of this Commandement of God, are the regions of darkneſſe repleniſhed with
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60349:105"/> inhabitants, and the chambers of death fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with gueſts, to be lodged in ſhame and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ever.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to eaſe the burthen of this exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (to the ſervice of God) where (I conceive) it wringeth and pincheth moſt, upon the ſhoulders of naturall and carnall men; conſider, that if you be but once really perſwaded, and made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take this yoke upon you, to conſecrate your ſelfe to this ſervice of God; all the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and burthenſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and unpleaſantneſſe thereof unto you, is paſt immediately. The g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eateſt
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60349:105"/> ſnare of death, wherein vaine and inconſiderate men are taken, and held from the ſervice of God, (I conceive) is this. They conceive, and imagine, that the waies of God, and religious courſes, which are ſo contrary unto their natures, and wherein they taſte a bitterneſſe like death, for the preſent, will never be healed of this antipathy and unſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to them, but will continue alike bitter and diſtaſtefull, to the end. Upon which apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart is enraged, againſt all that is called holy, and ſtands off at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance with ſpirituall courſes, feeding upon, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60349:106"/> ſtrengthening it all with this reaſoning, that it ſhall never be able to hold out in a way of that enmitie, and irkeſomeneſſe to it: and ſo reſolves never to taſte or make tryall of it, but ſeekes matter of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and quarrell, and exception againſt it. Therefore to remove this ſtumbling ſtone out of the way of theſe men, and to repreſent the ſervice of God upon more hopefull, and deſirable termes unto them, than ſo: I deſire this may be taken into knowledge and diligent conſideration: that if men ſhall ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves to be perſwaded, to be really, truly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60349:106"/> willing to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ſervice of God, by meanes onely of this change in their mindes, and hearts, the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſſe and offenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thoſe wayes, and courſes, wherein God is to be ſerved, will be eaſed and taken away. To move upwards towards the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, is a motion as naturall, and of as much eaſe and delight to fire, as moving downewards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the center, is to a ſtone, or other heavy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and a ſtone, if it were changed into fire, or had a contrary p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>openſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of levitie put into it, would performe the mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion upwards, with as
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60349:107"/> much eaſe and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as now it moves downwards. So to the figge-tree, it is no more labour or paines, to bring forth that ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant fruit wee call figs, nor to the vine to bring forth grapes, than it is to the thorne to bring forth that harſh &amp; ſowre fruit, which is proper to it: or to the thiſtle, that unprofitable flower that grows upon it. In like manner, when the frame of the heart, &amp; bent of the will are cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> new diſpoſitions &amp; incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are planted in the ſoule, wayes of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; holineſſe, are as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto him, &amp; of as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall &amp; ſweet compliance
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60349:107"/> with his ſpirit, as wayes of vanitie and looſeneſſe were, whilſt his heart was yet carnall. <hi>It is joy</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov. 21. 15.) to the juſt, to do judgement:</hi> and what can it be more to the drunkard, to be drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or to the uncleane, to practiſe uncleanneſſe? <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith, that his ſoule ſhould be fill'd with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and fatneſſe, when he remembred God on his bed. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 5. 6. And can the ambitious mans ſpeculation of all his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and greatneſſe; or the covetous mans rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all his treaſures and riches, yeeld them a more cordiall extraction, or more ſpiritfull quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60349:108"/> then this? When the heart is renewed, there is an agreement made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the man, and the commandements of God, and then they can walke friendly and lovingly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Yea, it is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, that wayes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe are as connaturall, and pleaſing to a man, when he hath changed his carnall heart for a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as wayes of ſenſualitie were before: but there is ſeven times, yea ſeventie times ſeven times more inward contentment, and ſatisfaction to him, in theſe wayes now, than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver there was in thoſe falſe and crooked wayes of ſin before. This were eaſie
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60349:108"/> to demonſtrate: but I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to the fift and laſt motive, which I diſpatch in few words.</p>
                  <p>Therefore fifthly, (and laſtly,) to render the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, too deſirable unto thee (if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to be refuſed, conſider, how great the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the reward is, that belongs unto it, and is ſetled upon it, with as good ſecurity as heaven it ſelfe can give. Suppoſe the worke were never ſo hard and ſore, and that to ſerve God, were to dwell among lyons, or in the ſhadow of death all a mans dayes: to <hi>fight with beaſts after the manner of men,</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſometimes

                  <p>For the opening of the Doctrine, two things would be explained: Firſt, what it is to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God: Secondly, how this promiſe of being a Sanctuary, made to ſuch a Sanctification of him, is to be underſtood, and how farre to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The word is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attributed to God himſelfe, hee is ſaid to ſanctifie: and ſometimes to the creature. God is ſaid, ſometimes to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelfe, and his owne Name: &amp; ſometimes) and that more frequently) to ſanctifie his Creature: When he is ſaid to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60349:118"/> himſelfe, or his own name, it is for the moſt part (if not alwayes) ſpoke in reference to the thoughts and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men concerning him, being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> low and mean, and altogether unworthy of him and his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. In which caſe hee is oft ſaid to be polluted, and his name to be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. Now when God doth any thing, takes a courſe to vindicate or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver himſelfe, or his name from thoſe meane, and contemptible, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thoughts which men had of him before, and raiſeth the eſteem of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on high, in the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60349:119"/> mindes of men, he is ſaid to ſanctifie himſelfe. And ſo in the place cited from <hi>Ezechiel, chap.</hi> 38. 23. the magnifying of himſelfe, and the ſanctifying of himſelfe, are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as being of one and the ſame importance, and one interpreting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 When hee is ſaid to ſanctifie the creature, which is often aſcribed to him in the Scripture, and that both in reſpect of things, and in reſpect of perſons (ſee an Inſtance of both together, <hi>Exodus, 29. 44. I will ſanctifie the Tabernacle of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Altar: I will ſanctifie Aaron alſo, and his
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60349:119"/> ſonnes.</hi>) When (I ſay) God is ſaid to ſanctifie the Creature, this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be underſtood onely of an externall, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall, or Sacramentall kinde of ſanctification, a meere and bare Relative ſanctification (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all ſanctification is relative, or with relation) as in the place laſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. The Tabernacle, and Altar, and ſo <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his ſonnes, and ſo the whole nations of the Jewes, were thus ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by him; that is, God ſeparated them, and made a difference, and diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene them, and all other things, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the world, with
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60349:120"/> relation to himſelfe: And ſometimes againe, when hee is ſaid to ſanctifie the creature, it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a reall and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſanctification: when hee doth not onely ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or ſet apart the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for ſome ſpeciall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and in ſome ſpeciall Relation to himſelfe, but withall make him parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of his owne nature and holineſſe. The word ſanctifying in this ſenſe is ſound, eſpecially in the New Teſtament, as in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 17. Chriſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Father to ſanctifie his Diſciples: <hi>Sanctifie them with thy Truth, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 26. that hee might ſanctifie, &amp; cleanſe

And the very God of peace ſanctifie you wholly, &amp;c.</hi> Thus you ſee in what ſenſe the word is uſed, when applyed to God: both in reſpect to himſelfe, and to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Againe, when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the creature, to men, it is with reference to the ſame object; though not altogether in the ſame ſenſe or ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For men are ſaid ſometimes to ſanctifie themſelves, ſometimes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things (and perſons too) beſides themſelves, and ſometimes God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (as in this place, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60349:121"/> ſome others) Not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon the ſignification of the word, where it is ſpoke with reference to other Objects (becauſe this may be gathered, by what hath beene already ſaid) but onely to open the force and importance of it in Relation to God himſelfe, and to ſhew in what ſenſe the creature may be ſaid to ſanctifie him. Now then the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be ſaid to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie God two waies, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther externally onely, and in the face as (<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes) or inwardly, and in the heart alſo: as <hi>Peter</hi> (alluding to the Scripture in hand) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it. But <hi>Sanctifie
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60349:121"/> the Lord God in your hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Now this is to be conſidered, that that ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying God, which is externall, or in the face onely may be ſeparated from that in the heart: but that in the heart cannot be ſeparated from it: as there may be a picture or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a man, where there is no Realitie or ſubſtance of the perſon of a man: but whereſoever there is a man, there is the appearance and likeneſſe of a man alſo.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 But what is it to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie God externally: I anſwer, it is either by word, or by deed, to ſet forth the glory of God in his attributes, and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60349:122"/> ſo, that by ſuch words or works, God may be ſeparated, that is, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and diſtinctly knowne from all other things, or perſons whatſoever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heaven or in earth, that are not God: to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie God, properly, is nothing elſe, but to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate him to and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, from all creatures, being, and poſſible to be: to deliver him (as it were) out of the hand of all common, and polluted thoughts, and opinions that men either have, or poſſibly may have of him: where he is ranked, and lodged (as it were) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt creatures, and hath no more glory given
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60349:122"/> him, no more mercy, goodneſſe, truth, power, wiſedome, &amp;c. aſcribed unto him, then creatures have (or at leaſt might have) now when any thing is either done or ſpoke by the creature, whereby God may be ſeparated, and drawne out (as it were) from amongſt ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, prophane, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted thoughts, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions concerning him, ſo that now he may be conceived of by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and like himſelfe, and like no other, but infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely above all: This properly is to ſanctifie him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 And that this is the true Notion and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60349:123"/> of this phraſe of ſanctifying God, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare from thoſe paſſages cited out of <hi>Ezek. 36. 23. And I will ſanctifie my great Name, which was pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted among the Heathen, among whom you have pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and the Heathen ſhall know that I am the Lord.</hi> Cleerly implying, that as the polluting of God, or his name, lyeth in this, when the Creature is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted or occaſioned to have low and common thoughts of him, and not to know him to be the Lord; that is, to be that which hee is in his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and ſoveraigntie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all creatures: ſo on the contrary, the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60349:123"/> of him, or of his name ſtands in this, when any, thing is done, by which his glory may breake out, and himſelfe be (as it were) ſeene, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in his greatneſſe by the creature. Now the glorifying of God or Chriſt, and the ſanctifying of God or Chriſt, are things that doe not differ in ſubſtance, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect onely, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. To glorifie God, is to doe that which ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abſolutely tends to the manifeſtation of his excellencie or glory in any kinde, without any relation to the creature, but to ſanctifie God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is (as hath beene
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60349:124"/> ſaid) to do that which tends to exalt the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and greatneſſe of God by way of diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, from, or above his creature. Onely this is to be further remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred (in a word) concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this outward ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of God; that this may be done ſometimes by wicked men, and when the heart is not honeſt and upright in the doing of it, Naturall men may ſometimes glorifie or ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie God, as the naturall or unreaſonable creature doth, that is to ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any knowledge or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of any ſuch end in their actions. <hi>The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 19.

                     <hi>declare the glory of God:</hi> and in that reſpect may be ſaid to ſanctifie him. So <hi>Caiphas</hi> when he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, and <hi>Iudas</hi> when hee confeſſed he had ſinned in betraying innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t blood, glorified God: but this glorifying or ſanctifying God was not their end in what they did, this end ſet them not a work to do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore they glorified God without any reward.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 But this for the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſanctifying of God; which though it be not the principall ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here intended, yet is it included and intended, as well as the other, which is the internall,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60349:125"/> and that which is in the heart. And what this is may readily, and clearly be underſtood by what hath beene already ſayd concerning the outward: for looke what worke or effect it is, which by the externall ſanctifying of God, when this proſpers and takes place in the hearts of others, is wrought there: when we worke, act, or doe the ſame in our ſelves, and in our owne hearts, this is our internall ſanctifying of him. And this worke or duty of ſanctifying God internally, and in the hearts, we may well place in theſe foure things.</p>

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60349:126"/> power, &amp;c. import, at leaſt indefinitely, and by way of negation, that is, that by an infinite love, is meant, a love more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe, large, and fervent, than by any created, and finite underſtanding can be comprehended.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in a true, and unfained beleeving that ſuch perfections, even in that height and ſurpluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage above all that is found in the creature, are truly, and really in God, and in him alone.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in deliberate, and ſerious contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or conſideration of theſe infinite perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, rightly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and firmly belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60349:126"/> to be in God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) in framing the heart, and compoſing the affections, and ſhaping, and faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all a mans purpoſes, intentions and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in an anſwerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and comely manner, thereunto, that is, to theſe attributes of God ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, beleeved and conſidered upon: though if wee ſpeake ſtrictly, and properly, the duty wee ſpeake of ſtands preciſely in the laſt of the foure, the having the heart, and and all the counſels, and purpoſes of it tamed, and ſet in a juſt and ſweete proportion to the Name or Attributes of God,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60349:127"/> ſo that every thing, which is in God, as Mercy, Truth, Power, Wiſdome, &amp;c. &amp; not only ſo, but that the proportion of every thing, of all theſe: that is, that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or overplus, wherin all theſe &amp; the like are found in God above what they are in any creature, may have a peculiar, proper, &amp; diſtinct effect ſutable to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the heart &amp; ſoule of man. Even as we ſee a ſeale, that is well cut or graven, when it is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wax well te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pered, &amp; ſoft, doth not leave an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, or likeneſſe of it ſelf in a generall, or confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed manner upon the wax, but you ſhall ſee letter for letter, point for point, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60349:127"/> every part of the inciſion in the ſeale, will have its peculiar, and diſtinct ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon the waxe, ſo is the great God then ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in the heart of a man or woman indeed, when there is no attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute in God, but you may finde it there, and that not only in the nature or kind of it, but in the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or dimenſion of it too: as when not onely the goodnes of God is found in our love to him, but the proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his goodnes, fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the meaſure &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of our love: &amp; ſo not onely his truth and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe found in, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him, but the unqueſtionableneſſe,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60349:128"/> or infallibility of his truth, and faithfulneſſe found in the freeneſſe, willingneſſe, ſtrength, and intireneſſe of our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him: and ſo in other his attributes.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Not as if we were able to draw the full proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Gods Attributes, which we know are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, in the narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of our hearts or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: there is no roome or ſpace for any thing that is infinite to ſtand there, in its poſitive, and proper Notion. As for example: a creature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love God with any ſuch infiniteneſſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is infinite in him: but
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60349:128"/> yet the infiniteneſſe of the goodneſſe of God may be thus repreſented in our love, and affections to him: wee may love him with a love ſtronger and greater then any love wee beare to the creature, or know that wee ought to beare unto any creature whatſoever; and this is interpretatively infinite: that is, it is ſuch love, as plainly confeſſeth, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the object of it to be infinite. The ſame is to be conceived touching all other holy impreſſions, diſpoſitions, and inclinations raiſed in the heart or ſoule, by a due conſideration of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God. As for
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60349:129"/> thoſe other three things mentioned, right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the nature, and infinitie of theſe divine perfections or attributes, the ſettled beliefe or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of their being in God, together with an effectuall conſideration of them, as united and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in him; theſe (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) are not parts of this dutie (this ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God) but rather acts of the minde, or ſoule, precedently requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. A man cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſanctifie God, with that internall, and ſpeciall ſanctification, which this Scripture principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires (and which hath
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60349:129"/> in part beene deſcribed) without ſomewhat done more or leſſe in all theſe. Hee that either knoweth not, what infinite love, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdome, power, &amp;c. meane and import, or beleeveth not that ſuch natures, are indeed in God, in their infiniteneſſe: or laſtly, doth not affectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly contemplate, or conſider theſe things in him, can never worke his heart to that cloſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire dependance upon God, which is the ſpeciall ſanctification of him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired there &amp; elſewhere, in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 For that (in a word) is further to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that howſoever the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60349:130"/> phraſe and expreſſion of ſanctifying God in the Scripture, be indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed for the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him in any kinde, that is for them agnifying of him in any one of his Attributes, whether love, mercy, goodneſſe, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, &amp;c. particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly: yet it is in ſpeciall manner, and with greateſt propriety, and (as I take it) more frequently uſed for that ſanctification of him which is by dependance, or reliance on him. This of all other acts, or kindes of ſanctifying God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the creature, is the greateſt, and of moſt acceptation with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a magnifying
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60349:130"/> or glorifying of him in many Attributes at once, and thoſe in whoſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation, and glory hee is beſt ſatisfied and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. A man may ſanctifie God in his mercie, or in his wiſedome, or in his power, or in his truth, and faithfulneſſe, ſeverally, and apart, when hee doth not exerciſe any ſpeciall act of dependance upon him. A man may either in words or diſcourſe, or elſe in minde and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or both, ſingle out any attribute of God from all it's fellowes: hee may exalt and magnifie the power of God alone by it ſelfe, without putting any glory in one kinde or
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60349:131"/> other upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, but hee that actually depends upon God, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies them all, and ſo ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies God in them all. For if a man doubts or queſtions, whether there be any thing wanting in God, either in nature or perfection, either in kinde or degree to make him a God indeed, a God meete or worthy to be relyed upon, ſuch a man will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be whole and intire, and cloſe in his depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him: there will be ſome faultering, and fumbling (as it were) and ruſtineſſe in his faith: the heart, and ſoule of a man will ſtill boggle, and make a ſtand, and demurre,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60349:131"/> yea and be ready to give backe in ſuch a caſe. It is not the greatneſſe of God alone, that will make the creature depend on him, neither is it his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer alone that will do it: nor his faithfulneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; no, but there muſt be a concurrence of all theſe (and others too) in God, to make him a God in caſes of great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and dangers to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on. Therefore now when the creature doth indeed and in truth, and with all the weight of his ſoule, caſt himſelfe upon God, and depend on him, hee ſanctifieth God not in one, or ſome, but in many (or rather
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60349:132"/> indeed in all) his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and perfections. And this (doubtleſſe) is that ſpeciall ſanctifying of God by way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires at our hands in this place, ſo that he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Sanctuary unto us.</p>
                  <p>The ſcope of the place, with the whole car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the context, and more particularly, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe two clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as it were by way of explication, <hi>let him be your feare, and let him be your dread,</hi> lead our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings (as it were by the hand) to this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo that we ſhall not need to contend further
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60349:132"/> about this, to prove that by ſanctifying God in this place, is meant, a ſtable, and comfortable depending on him. See the word uſed in a ſenſe importing truſt, or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance elſwhere: 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 15. Num. 20. 12. 27. 14. Eſa.</hi> 29. 23. This is the firſt thing to be opened in the point.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 The ſecond thing to be opened for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clearing of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, how the promiſe is here to be taken, that God will be a Sanctuary to thoſe that ſhall ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him (as you have heard) whether it be to be reſtrained onely to a ſoule protection, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it onely this, that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60349:133"/> God will have a care of ſuch in times of dangers, difficulties, &amp;c. ſo that the things of their everlaſting peace ſhall ſuffer no loſſe or dammage by all the ſtormes and tempeſts of outward troubles that may fall on them: that their ſoules ſhall not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, that no winde ſhall ſhake that corne of theirs: or whether it be to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended further to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward protection alſo, as that God would either preſerve or keepe them, ſo that the trouble ſhall not take hold of them, or hide them under his winge, where the danger that findes out others by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and thouſands, ſhall
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60349:133"/> not finde out him: or at leaſt, that hee would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them through, and bring them againe, with comfort and peace in this preſent world, though they might happily drinke deepe of the cup with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For anſwer to this. It is out of all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that that great prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſoule is here included however, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, or aymed at, or no. Thoſe that ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctifie him in the times of great water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floods (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes) of great dangers, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique calamities, or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whether they have their lives or no given
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60349:134"/> them for a prey, they ſhall have their ſoules given them for a prey: neither tribulation, nor anguiſh, nor perſecution, nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, nor nakedneſſe, nor perill, nor ſword, nor life, nor death, ſhall be able to ſeparate them from the love of God in Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Therefore of this there is no queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 But concerning the other kinde of protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or temporall delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, &amp;c. it may be ſomewhat more queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, whether that be here included and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or no. Yet by that immediately followeth, as likewiſe by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtreame, and currant of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60349:134"/> the Scripture, both for promiſes, and examples in this kinde (ſome whereof wee ſhall produce for the confirmation of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) it ſeemes that even this kinde of protection alſo is here included, if not principally, and directly intended. For ſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. <hi>And hee ſhall be a ſanctuary,</hi> that is to ſay, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you (as wee ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) but as a ſtumbling ſtone, and as a rocke of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to both the houſes, &amp;c. This is apparently ſpoke of, of thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and temporall judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and calamities, which the wicked Jewes, both thoſe of the tenne Tribes, and thoſe of the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60349:135"/> two would bring upon themſelves by not ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying God, by not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and depending upon him, and not of eternall judgements. Therefore that which God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to thoſe that ſanctifie him, by way of oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to what hee threatneth againſt thoſe that would not ſanctifie him, muſt be underſtood (principal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly at leaſt) of outward mercies and protections. And beſides, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 16. where the very phraſe is uſed, of Gods being a Sanctuary, it is in ſpeciall manner meant of outward protection, and that as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly as ſatisfaction it ſelfe can deſire.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:60349:135"/>12 There is yet a third way to interpret this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or phraſe of Gods being a ſanctuary unto his people, which will ſtand well with both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and yet is differing from either. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be ſaid to be a Sanctuary unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>viz.</hi> to thoſe that ſhall ſo ſanctifie him (as you have heard) not onely in reſpect of ſoule-protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from hell, nor of bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and outward protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from externall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and miſeries: but in reſpect of heart-protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as wee may call it) from the ſad piercing and tormenting feares, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, both of the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60349:136"/> one and of the other. For there is not onely paines, and torments in hell, but in the feare of hell alſo: ſo there is not anguiſh and perplexitie of ſoule onely in ſuffering, and enduring outward miſeries and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, but in the feare and expectation of them, and their iſſue. And for outward miſeries and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, the truth is, not onely that the feares and expectation of them; are many times a greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and burden upon the ſoule, then themſelves are: but if the ſoule were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly healed, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from feare, touching the event and iſſue of them; the griefe of bearing
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60349:136"/> and ſuffering them would be no great burden to it. And this ſenſe I conceive to be as naturall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the place, as either of the other: yet ſo, as to exclude neither of them. For the truth is, when God undertakes to be a Sanctuary, hee will be a Sanctuary indeed.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 So that now, when I lay it downe in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that God will be a Sanctuary or protection in dangers, to thoſe that ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie him, I would not have this limited to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the two kindes laſt mentioned (for as for the firſt, wee ſhall not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have to doe within this point) either to that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60349:137"/> which is from outward dangers and troubles, or to that which is from feares, and diſtractions of ſoule, in and about ſuch dangers and troubles. Nor yet on the other hand would I have it univerſally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to them both, as if God would alwaies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect: thoſe that ſanctifie him, from both, both from dangers, and evils themſelves, and alſo from feares and perplexities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them: but I would have the word taken, though in the latitude of it's ſignification, yet in a diſtributive ſenſe, thus, that God will certainly be a Sanctuary in times of trouble unto ſuch: but
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60349:137"/> not alwaies a Sanctuary in the ſame kinde, or upon the ſame termes, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies by an externall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of them from troubles, that they ſhall not fall upon them; not alwaies by delivering them, and bringing them off, when they are fallen upon them: not alwaies by guarding, and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting their hearts againſt the feare of them; but yet a Sanctuary alwaies: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Sanctuary of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, or a Sanctuary of deliverance, if not from the dangers, and evils themſelves, (yet that which it more, and the greater deliverance) from the oppreſſing, raging,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60349:138"/> and devouring feares, and terrours of them. So that ſtill wee make good, in the ſence, and meaning of our doctrine, the truth of what the Lord here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth by his Prophet, that is to ſay, that God will be a Sanctuary in one kind or other to thoſe that ſhall ſanctifie him, in times of danger. Now we have the cleare and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct meaning of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Let us proceed to the proofe and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, of the truth of it, and that firſt by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſecondly by grounds of reaſon.</p>

When God is the hope of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> depends upon him, then he is the Saviour of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his troubles; ſo, to the ſame Prophet, and his remnant (as hee calls them) that is the godly party, who had ſtucke to God and made his dependance upon him, when all his people (in a manner) would have quarrelled and perſecuted him out of his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60349:143"/> hee makes this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: <hi>The Lord ſaid, Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it ſhall be well with thy Remnant.</hi> So againe, <hi>chap. 17. Bleſſed is the man that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe hope the Lord is, for he ſhall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out her rootes by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſhall not ſee when heat commeth, but her leafe ſhall be greene, and ſhall not be carefull in the yeare of drought, neither ſhall ceaſe from yeelding fruit.</hi> By this tree's not ceaſing to yeeld fruit in a year of drought, hee expreſſeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, peace, and joy, which ſhould live in the heart, and ſoule of thoſe, who made the Lord their hope,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60349:143"/> in times of greateſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, when there ſhould be no viſible or outward meanes either to raiſe or to maintaine them. So <hi>Ioel 3. 16. The Lord ſhall roare out of Zion, and utter his voyce from Ieruſalem; but the Lord will be the hope</hi> (or harbour) <hi>of his people, and the ſtrength of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael.</hi> So <hi>Nahum, 1. 7. The Lord is good: a ſtrong hold in the day of trouble: and hee knoweth</hi> (that is, regardeth, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth) <hi>them that truſt in him.</hi> You may adde to theſe diverſe other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent this way: as, <hi>Amos 9. 8, 9. Mal. 3. 18. Eſa 1. 27. &amp; Eſa</hi> 6. 13. In all
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:60349:144"/> which places we ſhall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perceive that the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and fulleſt ſtreame runnes upon either a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from, or a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection under, or a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of publique judgements, and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to thoſe that ſanctifie God by dependance on him in ſuch times.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 If it be objected: but are not thoſe who do ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie God, and depend upon him, many times taken away, and utterly conſumed and deſtroyed by publique judgements, as peſtilence, ſword, &amp;c. and that in ſuch a manner, as no difference at all can be made betweene them and others? To this I
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60349:144"/> anſwer two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt it is not ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, as may appeare from the Scriptures cited in way of proofe for our Doctrine, it is ſeldome ſeene or heard of, that a man is cut off by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique judgement, in the ſtrength of his depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, indeed, if they pollute their Sanctuary in heaven with inordinate feares, may ſuffer in ſuch a way: <hi>Peters</hi> faith ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his life (wee know) ſympathized, and was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken alſo with it: but this is that, whereof (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) few inſtances (if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) can be given, that a publike judgment ſhould
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60349:145"/> be ſent to ſlay any man that hath his hand faſt upon the hornes of this Altar. For the moſt part, faith and dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, (as <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeakes of mercy,) rejoyce againſt judgement, and triumph over the ſtroke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Secondly: ſuppoſe men and women have beene thus taken in their bed of this heavenly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, have beene ſmitten, when they have beene cloſe and ſtrong, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in their dependance upon God, yet <hi>impavidos feriebant ruinae</hi> (as he ſaid) the ſtroke did them no great harme. Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their hearts were in
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:60349:145"/> Sanctuary: the truth and faithfulneſſe of God, who hath in effect promiſed, that all things ſhall work together for good to thoſe that love him, was ſhield, and buckler to the inner man: ſo that as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. that to live, and to die were to him alike; the difference betweene the one and the other was ſo narrow in his eye, that hee was in a ſtraight, he knew not which to chuſe: but yet of the two (ſerting cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances aſide) hee would rather die than live, hee would be diſſolved, and be with Chriſt, that was beſt for him. So when the heart or ſoule
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:60349:146"/> of a man is erected and lifted up on high in a rich dependance upon God, the one way or the other, going or ſtaying, life or death, there is little to chuſe betweene them. Feare hath paine (ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi>) and the truth is, that ſcarce any thing elſe hath paine, except there be ſome kinde of feare or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, joyned with it. Take any ſore, or tormenting diſeaſe or ſickneſſe, as ſtone, or gout or the like, if there were not ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and feare of the continuance, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of them, the very inſtant paine would be eaſily digeſted, and no great matter made of it:
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60349:146"/> ſo when God hath guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and fenced the heart of a man with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his grace (as it were) with a wall of fire round about; ſo that no feare or apprehenſion of evill can breake in upon it to ſmite and wound it, the evill it ſelfe, when it comes, is of no great concernment; it cannot much afflict or annoy the ſoule: ſo that whether preſervation from danger, or no preſervation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deliverance out of danger, or no deliverance, (I meane till death) that comes much to the ſame to thoſe, to whom God will be a Sanctuary, that is, to thoſe that ſanctifie
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60349:147"/> him. If God be a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, either from the evill, or from the feare of the evill, it makes no great difference in the eſtate and condition of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Of the two he hath the better acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modation from his Sanctuary (I conceive) whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection ſerveth againſt feares. The reaſons of the point are foure.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 And this happily is worthy ſome obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that the holy Ghoſt uſually taketh occaſion
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:60349:149"/> upon ſuch Promiſes as theſe, made for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe and deliverance of thoſe that truſt in God in times of danger and trouble, to commend and magnifie the moſt infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible truth, and certainty of the word of God: for this reaſon eſpecially (as I conceive) becauſe the truth and certaintie of it ſuffers moſt from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving hearts of men, in ſuch promiſes as theſe. And therefore the Holy Ghoſt, here interpoſeth a ſpeciall teſtimony of the truth and faithfulneſſe of it, as it were on purpoſe to prevent and diſappoint the ſpirit of unbeleefe in mee, that that might
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60349:149"/> not riſe up ſo much as to mutter or whiſper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it in this behalfe. Thus <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 12. 5, &amp; 6. The Lord having promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that for the oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the poore, and ſighing of the needy, hee would ariſe and ſet them at libertie, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. The Prophet ſubjoynes this <hi>Elogium</hi> or teſtimony of the word, or promiſe of God. <hi>The words of the Lord are pure words, as ſilver tried in a furnace of earth purified ſeven times,</hi> that is, throughly purified; till all the droſſe be conſumed and purged cleane from it, ſo that there is nothing but the pure and ſolid mettall remaining: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60349:150"/> that there is no light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or looſeneſſe at all the promiſes of God, made to thoſe that put their truſt in him, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry jot and title will beare the weight, if it were of the whole world laid upon it. So <hi>Prov. 30. 5. Every word of God is pure,</hi> that is, every promiſe of God is ſolid, maſſie, and intire truth. Hee is a ſhield to thoſe that put their truſt in him, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The ſecond reaſon is becauſe there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and fitneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene this duty, this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſment of the creature to God, in away of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and his addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60349:150"/> himſelfe to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in a way of mercy, and deliverance: there is a ſutablenes &amp; anſwerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes between the one &amp; the other. As it a thing meete &amp; comely in the creature, to ſtay it ſelfe upon God, and to wait his leaſure for it's deliverance. So is a compliance in God with his creature in this poſture (as it were) of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, comely and glorious in him. The great God of heaven and earth hath no apparell to put on, in all that infinite charge and variety hee hath, more glorious, or wherein he can commend himſelfe: and his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon higher termes
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60349:151"/> to his creature, than this, his ſaving thoſe that put their truſt in him. Hence it is the Saints of God, to ſtrengthen their hand in prayer, uſually plead their faith and dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God for deliverance: as if this were a ground and foundation to build an aſſured hope upon, that God now will not reject them. <hi>Pſalm. 33. 21, 22. Surely our heart ſhall rejoyce in him</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) becauſe wee have tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in his holy name. Let thy mercy O Lord be upon us as we truſt in thee.</hi> As if he had a pawne ſufficient of his faith, that God would ſend him helpe, wherein hee ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60349:151"/> So <hi>Pſalme 25. 2. O my God I truſt in thee; let mee not be aſhamed, &amp;c.</hi> So againe, <hi>Pſalme 86. 2. O God ſave thy ſervant that truſteth in thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 Hence likewiſe it is, that when men have been Idolaters, and lift up their hands to ſtrange gods, and yet will expect that the true God ſhould ſave and deliver them in the time of their trouble, hee ſends them for helpe and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to their falſe gods, whom they had choſen, and relied upon, implying that it was meete and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for thoſe that are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and relyed on, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver and protect thoſe that relyed on them. See
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60349:152"/> inſtances hereof in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and read <hi>Iudges 10. 14. Ier. 2. 28. Eſa 57. 13. &amp;c.</hi> Hence it is alſo, that God purpoſing to ſave and deliver his elect from the wrath to come, and to beſtow everlaſting life &amp; happineſſe upon them, would not yet actually conferre his ſalvation and glory upon them, till they firſt ſhall beleeve, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him for it. And therefore he did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give his ſonne Chriſt, to pay their ranſomes, and make attonement for their ſinnes, but alſo cauſed the Goſpell to be written, wherein the hiſtory of the life and death of Chriſt, together with the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60349:152"/> whole frame or body of the Myſterie of his will touching the ſalvation of men, ſhould be declared, and this Goſpell to be carried up and downe the world, from place to place, from Nation to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be preached unto men, that ſo men might firſt beleeve in him through Chriſt, or by meanes of Chriſt (as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. before they entred into their glory. By all which it appeareth, that God thinkes his mercies, and favours (and deliverances eſpecially) do beſt, and are given by him upon moſt equall, and righteous termes, when they are
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60349:153"/> grafted (as it were) upon faith, and given into the boſome of thoſe that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and waite for them before they come.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 A third reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if God by a ſpeciall work of his Spirit, ſhould uphold the hearts of his people to depend upon him for helpe, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect deliverance from dangers from him, and then ſhould not deliver them. Hee ſhould diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and diſcountenance the workemanſhip of his owne hands, yea that piece of worke, wherein hee takes ſpeciall delight. The Scripture every where derives the originall and diſſent of faith from
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60349:153"/> God, See <hi>Heb. 12. 2. Act.</hi> 18. 27. now it's certaine, that God will have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his owne workes, and will glorifie and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie them, that they may glorifie and magnifie him againe. If hee inclines and moves, and perſwades the creature truely, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly to reſt and ſtay it ſelfe upon him for helpe, in time of neede, (as hee doth, if the thing ever be done: no man takes hold upon God, but God himſelfe guides and ſtrengthens his hand to do it) certainly hee will not neglect, much leſſe ſhame and confound this great worke of his owne, which hee ſhould doe, if
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60349:154"/> hee ſhould ſuffer the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to miſcarry or periſh under it. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal. 10. 17.) thou haſt heard the deſire of the poore</hi> (or humble) <hi>thou wilt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, or</hi> (as it is in the margine) <hi>eſtabliſh their heart: thou wilt cauſe their eare to heare.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, when God prepares or eſtabliſheth the heart to pray, hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failes to give a grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearing to the prayer. Otherwiſe the worke of his owne grace ſhould ſuffer loſſe and diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The fourth and laſt reaſon may be, becauſe, beleeving, truſting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60349:154"/> on God, is a thing ſo much deſpiſed, reproched, neglected, and little ſet by in the world, indeed perſecuted (upon the matter) and this may provoke the jealouſie of the Lord, and cauſe him to caſt the more honour upon it, becauſe the world doth ſo much diſparage it. As <hi>David,</hi> who was well acquainted with Gods wayes, reaſoneth, upon the like occaſion, 2 <hi>Sam. 16. 12. It may be the Lord will looke upon mine affliction, and appoint good unto mee, for his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this day.</hi> Now the Scripture makes it cleare, that this dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, it is a practiſe in
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60349:155"/> the way of Chriſtians that hath alwaies undergone reproach, and have beene made a laughing ſtocke in the world. In the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 6. you have ſhamed the counſell of the poore, becauſe the Lord is his refuge: hee hath no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſupport, no friends in the world. Hee made the Lord his refuge, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you made a mocke at his way. And ſo the Scribes and Phariſees mocked Chriſt for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance hee had upon his father, <hi>Matth. 27. 34. Hee truſted in God: let him deliver him now, if hee will have him, for hee ſaid, I am the ſonne of God.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle tels us in the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60349:155"/> 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 10. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we labour, and ſuffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, becauſe wee truſt in the living God, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of thoſe that beleeve.</hi> Now then the ſpirit of the world, and the folly of men being ſet againſt this great worke of God in the hearts of his ſervants, they labouring to reproch and vilifie it; God ſets himſelfe ſo much the more to magnifie it, and make it glorious, for <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the World to confound the wiſe:</hi> and <hi>God hath choſen the weake things in the world to confound the mightie, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 27. that is, the things which the world
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:60349:156"/> counts fooliſh, and the things which the world counts weak to confound that which the world counts wiſe, and mightie; and will deſpiſe that which the world magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and magnifies that which the world deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>

                  <p n="4">4 Secondly, if God will

The rich mans riches, are of no conſideration at all, for the augmentation, or increaſe of his happines, being otherwiſe, ſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceeding, abundantly happy in Chriſt: neither

Hee loves a faire marke to ſhoote at, and will ſooner downe with Goliah the Champion, than with a common Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtine. It was eaſier for the Iſraelites (had they knowne the waies and counſels of God) to have beleeved the overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his mighty hoaſt, than to

                  <p n="4">4. To anſwere theſe things in few words: Let me aſke firſt: Would wee have a God to depend on

Doe we think wee could ſanctifie him better in his other Attributes, if theſe were wanting? Doubtleſſe a God without holineſſe (and ſo without righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe) were no God to depend upon: becauſe ſuch could be no true God, to whom holineſſe and righteouſneſſe are as eſſentiall, as power, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or any other Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute whatſoever.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60349:173"/> his power to our weaknes &amp; neceſſities, and ſo makes him a God (as it were) on purpoſe to be depended on, or that his creature might with al eaſe, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and readines, ſtay and repoſe it ſelfe upon him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And ſo for his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, or Juſtice: this is altogether with, and not at all againſt our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on him. For he that is Righteous and juſt, will keepe promiſe, and this is worthy all conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that although all other goodneſſe, grace, pitty, compaſſion, &amp;c. were wholly ſeparated from God, ſo that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not his creature at all, in the greateſt fears,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60349:173"/> exigencies, or extremities wherein he could behold it, yet if we can apprehend and confidently beleeve him to be juſt of his word, and a promiſe keeper, this alone is ſufficient to lift up the horne of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon him, even to the Heavens, and to make our reſt in him glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: The reaſon hereof is evident; becauſe he hath promiſed the covering of his wing, protection, ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and peace, to this very grace or act of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence alone (though the creature otherwiſe ſhould be never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of protection from him) as may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made manifeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

There needs no more but theſe two Pillars (if we ſpeak of a ſtrict &amp; abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity) wheron to build that houſe of confidence or dependence on God, wherein peace and ſafety ſhal dwell for ever. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither is the Juſtice

                  <p n="6">6. Again (ſecondly) to allay your fears in reſpect of the greatneſſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſiblenes of the Majeſty of God: I would demand this, how, or which way, or in what conſideration the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Majeſtie of God, ſhould any wayes ſhake, or be offenſive to our dependence upon him? It may be the evill managing, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent experience we have of the hard ways of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greatneſſe or power, have been a ſnare unto us, and made us judges of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60349:175"/> and unrighteous thoughts, concerning the Majeſtie and greatneſſe of God. Becauſe men that are great in power and pompe on Earth, and full of the glory of this world, are not wont to regard or look after, or take care for the poor and needy, and thoſe that are of mean condition in the world: they are liker to ride over their heads, then to take them up from the duſt of the earth, to oppreſſe them and grinde their faces, then to relieve and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them. And ſo the Tentation being upon us, we preſently fall before it; we meaſure the heavens by the earth; and him that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60349:176"/> is God, by thoſe that are called Gods; we conceive (it is like) that hee that ſits upon the Throne, which ruleth heaven and earth, that hath thouſand thouſands, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times ten thouſand of glorious Angels attending on him and miniſtring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him continually, that hath the Sunne and the Moon, and all the Starres in the firmament of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the windes and the Seas, the Hills and the Mountains in ſubjection to him, that hath all the great &amp; mighty Creatures on earth, Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with their Hoſts, whole Nations and Kingdoms at his command, that he, as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60349:176"/> he is lifted up in power and Majeſtie above all earthly Potentates what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, ſo hee is proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably eſtranged more then they, from all care or regard, or reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of Creatures, that are poore, weak, afflicted; that he is no wayes ſenſible of their fears, dangers, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, diſtreſſes, &amp;c. Liker to break their bones, then any wayes to heal or binde them up: to cruſh them in pieces and deſtroy them utterly, then to lift up their heads, and make their faces to ſhine.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed give Intimation that ſuch thoughts as theſe (and that upon this very
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60349:177"/> occaſion or tentation wee have now mentioned) are incident to the minds of men, touching the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Majeſty and greatnes of God: but withall hews the ſnare of death aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and delivers the ſouls of men (as it were) with joy and triumph from the bitterneſſe of it. <hi>The Lord is high above all nations</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal. 113. 4:) and his glory above the Heavens. Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth on high, who humbleth himſelf to behold the things done in Heaven and in the earth: he raiſeth the poore out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60349:177"/> ſay; God in his Majeſtie and greatneſſe hath this gracious property by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone, and there are very few or none of thoſe that partake with him in greatneſſe, that reſemble him therein, that is to ſay, to look with a gracious, mercifull and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate eye beneath him, to looke after the povertie and diſtreſſes of thoſe that lie at the greateſt diſtance of all from him; to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and deliver them: The reaſon why earthly greatnes and power have (for the moſt part) that evill influence into, and operation upon men, to diſpoſe them rather to the neglect, contempt, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60349:178"/> oppreſſion of the poore and thoſe that are beneath them, is becauſe they are defective and weake in goodneſſe, wiſedome, and true underſtanding: and know not (indeed) what to doe with that power and greatneſſe which is in their hand, to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: they know not how to contrive them for the beſt to themſelves, and their own good, but fall upon grievous and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate miſtakes, and turne all both to their own, and others ruine: but God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving goodneſſe and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome fully anſwerable to his greatneſſe, power, and excellencie of beeing: there is not the leaſt cauſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60349:178"/> to ſuſpect or fear, but that he ſhould manage the full power of his ſcepter, as well to the higheſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as for the happines and joy of his creature depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on him. neither can it be imagined that he could be ever the more gracious, mercifull or reſpectfull to the pooreſt and meaneſt of his creatures, if he could be ſuppoſed to be deveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all his Majeſty, or to have layed aſide all his greatneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But it may be thou art not yet all thought made, but wilt ſtill object and ſay: It is true, the children and ſervants of God, if they ſanctifie
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60349:179"/> him by ſuch a dependence upon him in time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as you have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is like they may ſee his ſalvation, be protected and delivered by him; the holines &amp; righteouſnes, &amp; greatnes of God, will make nothing againſt them: but I make queſtion of my ſelfe, whether I be in the number of either, and conſequently, whether I have any right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him, or no; I feare if I ſhould caſt my ſelfe upon God, or make any dependence upon him in an exigent or ſtraight, I ſhould rather be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for preſuming, then any wayes accepted in my dependence.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:60349:179"/>9. Give me leave to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere this objection; and then I have done. Firſt therefore, touching that occaſion of the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thy doubting whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou beeſt in the number of the children and ſervants of God, or no: I anſwer two things: Firſt, thy doubting, or making queſtion in this kind, is no argument or proofe at all, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art not in that number, I mean a child or ſervant of God: The reſt of the Apoſtles queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every man himſelf, whether he were the man that ſhould betray his Lord and Maſter Chriſt, did not prove that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60349:180"/> they were the men, or any of them that ſhould have a hand in that great ſinne, Nay this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and queſtioning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is generally inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceived rather as a teſtimony of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie this way. And (as it appears from the text, where this paſſage is related, <hi>Matth. 26. 22, 23, &amp;c.</hi>) hee that was the guilty perſon, and foule in his intentions that way, <hi>Judas,</hi> did not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion himſelf at firſt, with the reſt: but afterward, when Chriſt, to deliver the reſt from their feares, had ſingled him out by a ſigne, as good as by name, then the text ſaith, verſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60349:180"/> 25. that he alſo came in with his queſtion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, <hi>Maſter, is it I?</hi> The reaſon of which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his, ſeems to be this: Whileſt the reſt of his fellows were under feares and jealouſies of themſelves (and perhaps every one of another) he would ſeem to be the freeſt and moſt innocent man of them all: he would not ſeeme ſo much as to ſuſpect and doubt himſelf that way; but thought it policie to let them alone with the matter, to ſhift it out among themſelves as they could. But when he ſaw that Chriſt had as good as acquitted all the reſt, and had burdened
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60349:181"/> and branded him for the man of that wickedneſſe, he had now no better ſhelter or covert for his hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, then to joyn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with thoſe that were acquitted, in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of queſtioning. In like manner, jealouſies and doubtfull thoughts, now and then riſing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, touching our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſtandings and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as whether wee be hypocrites and unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or no, are rather ſigns on the right hand, then on the left, and ſpeak more for us, then againſt us. Men that are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrangers to the life of God, have (for the moſt part) more ſecuritie and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60349:181"/> confidence of their ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then to bee ſhaken with any diſputes in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about it: Nay ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to this particular, I anſwere yet further: that though thou ſhouldeſt lay violent thoughts upon thine own ſoule, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude right down againſt thy ſelfe, that thou wert no childe or ſervant of God, yet neither were this any materiall proofe, that therefore thou wert neither childe nor ſervant of his. As it is ſaid of God in one ſenſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the greatneſſe of his power (fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ling in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the motion of his will) that he calleth the things that are not, as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60349:182"/> if they were. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17. ſo may it in another ſenſe be ſaid of men, in reſpect of their weakneſſe, and ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie to judge, that they alſo call the things that are not, as if they were: they give beings to many things in their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which have no being at all otherwiſe. But though Gods calling things that are not, gives them a reality, and truth of being in themſelves: Yet mans calling them in his thoughts and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth not ſo. Things are never the more ſo or ſo, becauſe men conceive and imagine, or conclude them to be ſo upon inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient grounds. As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60349:182"/> alſo reaſoneth, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 15, 16. If the foot ſhall ſay, Becauſe I am not the hand, I am not of the body: is it therefore not of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? And if the ear ſhall ſay, Becauſe I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</hi> There is nothing more frequent and common with men, then to bee ſtrong and ſore in their concluſions, when they are but weake and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in their premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: then to ſit downe in their moſt reſolute deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations &amp; judgements, quite beſides the truth, neither is this more inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to any ſort of men, in, or about any ſubject
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60349:183"/> whatſoever, then to the children of God, in reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and arguing their ſpirituall conditions: as might be ſhewed by many inſtances, and is obſerved by experience: Therefore there is little in this ground of the objection, thy queſtioning whether thou beeſt a child of God, or no.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But ſecondly, to the maine and more mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall ground thereof, which ſeems to be this; that in caſe a man or a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be not the childe of God, they therefore have no right to depend upon God, or ſhould be rejected in their dependence, or or that the dependence of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60349:183"/> ſuch would be rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, then any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence accepted with God: to this (I ſay) I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere further, 1. By way of conceſſion. 2. By way of exception.</p>
                  <p>By way of conceſſion, I anſwere, and grant three things; Firſt that true it is, that the children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, have pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and ſpecial iucourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from him, to make their dependence upon him in times of danger, and to looke for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and protection from him. <hi>Ye that feare the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal. 115. 11. Pſal. 145. 19.) Truſt in the Lord:</hi> beſides many like paſſages, which (I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60349:184"/> conceive) may be found in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I grant, that wicked men, that is, men that continue in the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe and impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of their hearts and wayes, are every where threatned with wrath and vengeance, and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God for their ſinnes, and conſequently are diſcouraged, and that with a high hand, and in a terrible manner, from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting any good, mercy or favour from the hand of God; by reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, continuing and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to continue in their ſinnes, they have no ground at all to make any dependence upon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60349:184"/> God, for any grace or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in what kind ſoever. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7. 11, 12. 11. 6.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) I grant, that there is a kind of dependence, or truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on God, wherein the creature ſhall be rejected, &amp; which ſhal rather turn to his deeper ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, then any wayes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage or benefit him in the favour of God. The Scripture affords many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or examples here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of his enemies, <hi>They cryed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but there was none to ſave them: even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, but hee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them not.</hi> Then did I beate them ſmall as the duſt before the winde, &amp;c.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60349:185"/> 
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 18. 41, 42. Their calling and crying unto God, ſhewes plainly that they had ſome kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on him: as the Apoſtle argueth this point, <hi>Rom. 10. 14. How ſhall they call on him, on whom they have not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi> Invocation, always argueth ſome kinde of hope or dependence, one or other. So <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22. It is evident that thoſe that ſhould ſay unto Chriſt in that day, <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thy Name? and in thy Name caſt out Devils, &amp;c?</hi> had ſome kind of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon him, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation unto life and ſalvation: and yet we ſee
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60349:185"/> in the following verſe, how they were rejected: Then will I profeſſe unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, yee that work iniquitie. If you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee more inſtances, of this kind of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, you may (at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) peruſe theſe and the like paſſages. <hi>Eſa. 36. 10. Prov. 1. 28. Matth. 7. 26. Jere. 13. 16, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that neither is this to be denied, but that there have been, and are at this day many relyings, many dependings upon God, which hee will not owne, and to which the Sanctuary, here ſpoken of, will bee denied. Theſe things therefore I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60349:186"/> by way of conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But ſecondly, by way of exception, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere divers things: Firſt, that howſoever the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſervants of God, that is, men and women that are already conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and of ſome ſtanding and continuance in the wayes of grace, have ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall incouragements to ſtay themſelves upon God, and to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for protection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or deliverance out of dangers: yet as Chriſt told the people that ſtood by, when that voice came from heaven, and ſpake unto him, <hi>John</hi> 12. 28. that it came not becauſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60349:186"/> of him, but for their ſakes, who yet were unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as apeares verſe 37. and ſo, though he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly more beloved of God then they, yet in that particular, in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous voice, though directed particularly unto him, God reſpected them more then him: So in thoſe incouragements, for dependence on God, which are particularly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the children and ſervants of God, though God loves theſe many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees better then the reſt of the world, yet may he more reſpect the reſidue of men (at leaſt his elect, which yet lie hid amongſt them, walking in the ſame
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60349:187"/> wayes of ſin and vanity, with them) then his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſervants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. God may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeak graciouſly and comfortably, and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to thoſe that are his children and ſervants, to commend the ſweetnes of his ſervice unto others, and to draw them alſo to deſire part and fellowſhip in ſo bleſſed a buſineſſe: as the happineſſe of his Fathers ſervants, above the condition he was in (for the preſent) moved the Prodigall ſonne (wee know) to returne home to his Fathers houſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 17.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But ſecondly, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this be not ſo, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60349:187"/> God hath no ſuch eye upon thoſe that are yet without, that are yet the ſervants of ſin and Sathan, in thoſe gracious incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to his Saints, to make their dependence upon him, and to ſecure themſelves in his love and care over them in times of danger, yet further I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that not only righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous perſons, men and women, who have already embraced the wayes and ſervice of God, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to come unto him, and to depend on him, but even others alſo, yea, the greateſt of ſinners, and the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. <hi>Waſh you, make you clean, &amp;c.</hi> (ſaith the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60349:188"/> Lord, to the higheſt rank of ſinners, <hi>Eſa. 1. 16. 17. &amp;c.</hi>) and then: <hi>Come now, and let us reaſon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaith the Lord: though your ſinnes be as skarlet, yet ſhall they be as white as ſnow: though they be as red as crimſon, yet ſhall they be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, you ſhall eat the good things of the land.</hi> Surely God is willing that men ſhould depend upon him for the obtaining of ſuch things as hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth unto them: Now you ſee that here hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth both forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and outward proſperity to thoſe whoſe ſinnes were as skarlet, and crimſon, only upon their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60349:188"/> repentance. I might adde many more paſſages of like importance. If you here againe object: But I doubt whether I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, or no: and then I have never the more ground or right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him, for the making good of theſe, or any the like promiſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. To this, as alſo to the maine objection, I anſwere on</p>
                  <p n="13">13. In the third place: Suppoſe thou haſt not as yet repented, yet is the way as open unto thee, for thy truſting, relying, and depending upon God for all things that concerne thy peace, as it is for thy repentance: and thou haſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60349:189"/> as much right unto, and mayeſt as lawfully doe the one, as the other; as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully depend upon God for all good, as repent of thy ſinnes. Nay, as thou haſt, not only a lawfulnes and a right, but even an abſolute neceſſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance lying upon thee, ſo that woe be unto thee, if thou repent not: So is there, not only a like law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and right, but a like neceſſity alſo of this dependence upon God, upon thee, and the like condemnation abiding thee, if thou refuſeſt to make thy dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. <hi>Bleſſed is that man,</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>that maketh the Lord his truſt, Pſal.</hi> 40.

He doth not ſay, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is that godly, that righteous, that penitent man, that maketh the Lord his truſt: but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and in definitely, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is that man,</hi> whoſoever he be, how vile, how ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, how unworthy ſoever otherwiſe: this making the Lord his truſt, the caſting of himſelfe upon God in way of a true and unfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned dependence, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and remove the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and curſe lying upon him for his ſinne, and ſet a Crowne of bleſſedneſſe upon his head. As on the contrary, it is as a title, or ſuperſcription written upon the forehead of him that periſheth, contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60349:190"/> the cauſe of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation or periſhing: <hi>Loe, this is the man that made not God his ſtrength, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 52. 7. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Jere. 17. 5. Thus ſaith the Lord, Curſed be the man that truſteth in man, &amp; maketh fleſh his arme, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord.</hi> If the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the heart from the Lord, that is, a mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to make his depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon him, be that which makes him accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, doubtleſſe it is moſt lawfull for him to depend upon him: yea, as lawfull altogether, as it is to ſeek to deliver himſelfe from the curſe, or to eſcape the wrath which is to come.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60349:190"/> If God denounceth every man accurſed, for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying, not depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, this is a ſufficient ground and warrant (yea and more then either) for every man and woman under heaven, to do both the one and the other, to rely and depend upon him, without aſking any further queſtion for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake. For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God would never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce any man accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for not doing that, which he hath no right or warrant to doe. It were rather a ground of praiſe and reward from God to a wicked man, if he ſhould refuſe to depend upon him, in caſe hee had no
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60349:191"/> ground or warant for the doing it. That which makes it a ſinne of that high provocation in the ſight of God, with whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is found, in all perſons whatſoever that are guilty of it, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the abundant righteouſneſſe and equitie thereof, lying upon all men for the doing of it. So that there is not the leaſt ſcruple or queſtion to be made, but how ſinfull and unworthy ſoever thou conceiveſt thy ſelf to bee, thou haſt as much right, becauſe as great a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to depend and caſt thy ſelfe upon God, as the moſt righteous perſon
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60349:191"/> under Heaven. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                  <p n="14">14. In the fourth place, I anſwere yet further (and deſire it may be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) that a mans truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and depending upon God, is both the firſt, and the onely effectuall means or cauſe of every mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and hath a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, infallible, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall connexion with it; ſo that no man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon God (we ſpeak now of a true and unfain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dependence) but <hi>ipſo facto</hi> (as we ſay) in the very act of his depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he repenteth: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any man truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but he that truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon God, and that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60349:192"/> by the power, and native propertie and influence of that his dependence. For we are to conceive of God and ſinne, as of two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary terms, or two points in the heavens, diametral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite, or directly croſſe one to the other, as the Eaſt is to the Weſt, and the North to the South, &amp;c. So that whilſt a mans face is towards ſin, that is, whilſt he remaines impenitent and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, his back is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, that is, he ſees not that in him, why hee ſhould truſt him, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him: as a man whileſt his face is towards the Weſt, his back muſt needs be toward the Eaſt.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60349:192"/> And the reaſon why any man remaines in an eſtate of impenitencie, is not ſo much (as happily we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) the pleaſure, or profit, or contentment of ſinne in any kinde, as the ignorance of God, of that infinite goodneſſe, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, mercie, bountie, truth, power, &amp;c. that are in him; though it be true alſo, that there are bands, and ſnares, and cords of vanity in ſinne, which bind men heart and hand to it, and ſo keepe them faſt; making them liſtleſſe and careleſſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after God and his wayes, till God by a high hand of grace, prevants them with ſuch a light of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60349:193"/> the knowledge of himſelf, as doth deliver them. For if there were not the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth part of that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, profit, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſinne, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent perſons conceive there is, yet they remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of God, and without knowledge of thoſe riches of his grace, which expoſe him in all his greatneſſe, power, and all-ſufficiencie, to every creature under heaven, that is but willing to come unto him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him, without any other condition or qualification whatſoever, would never repent of their ſins.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. If God ſhould
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60349:193"/> grind the face of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as it were) and take out all the flower and pith of it, and leave nothing but huſks and ſhells; yet men would not give over feeding upon theſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they were perſwaded of finding better inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment with God. If covetouſneſſe were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo pleaſing or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the corrupt hearts of men, as now it is, if the heat of the pleaſure of drunkenneſſe, idle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, uncleanneſſe, and the like, were abated and taken down never ſo low; yet the covetous would be covetous ſtill, and the drunkard would follow drunkenneſſe ſtill, and the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60349:194"/> adulterer would be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterer ſtill, except hee ſaw in God an effectuall dore open unto him, by which he might enter, and finde grace &amp; acceptation with him. Againe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that ſin doth, or can doe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with the heart of a man, to deteine it in the love, practiſe and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of it, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the ſtrong allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and effectuall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witchings it hath attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it to keepe men in bondage and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it, nay if ſinne were more ſinfull (in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) then it is, I meane, more alluring, and more tempting, and more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60349:194"/> then now it is: yet upon the ſhining of the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt upon the ſoul, upon the appearing of the bountifulneſſe and love of God our Saviour towards man (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4.) the heart of a man would breake looſe from ſinne, and caſt all the cords of it from him: he would turn his back upon it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and come about with his face towards God. By both which conſiderations (which are both cleere in reaſon, and might be ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the word of God, if it were neceſſary)
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60349:195"/> it is fully evident, that the main and principall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any mans continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in his impenitencie, is not ſo much any thing he finds in thoſe wayes of ſin wherein he lives; no nor yet in thoſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of nature, which make thoſe wayes of ſin ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing above meaſure unto him, as his not depending upon God. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion being granted (as it cannot with any colour be denied) it neceſſarily follows, that men muſt begin, and make entrance upon their repentance, by way of truſt, or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon God.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. A man muſt not think, that either hee

                     </gap>n, firſt repent, and then truſt and depend upon God: no, all that a man can finde, or feele, or feare in ſin, will not raiſe the ſoule ſo much as to the firſt and loweſt ſtep of a ſound and true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, till he hath taken ſome hold on the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, and begun (at leaſt) his dependence upon God. In the raiſing, and framing of which act of dependence, in the ſoul, the heart falls off, and comes about from ſinne: which is the ſubſtance and nature of a true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. So that, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, To beleeve, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, are things much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in conſideration,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60349:196"/> and alſo in reſpect of their objects, it being God, that is beleeved on, and ſinne that is repented of: yet are they effected and wrought by God, in or by one and the ſelfe ſame work or motion, in the heart or ſoul of a man. For by that act of the Spirit of grace, by which the ſoul is turned and acted upon God in beleeving, by the ſame it is turned away from ſin alſo: which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is repentance. And look, as when a man turns his backe towards the weſt, and his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Eaſt, he doth both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not by two diſtinct motions or turnings of his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60349:196"/> body, but by one and the ſame, neither can he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly turn his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the one, but he muſt of neceſſitie, by and with the ſame motion turne his back upon the other: So is it between Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: God doth not worke Faith by one work of his Spirit by it ſelfe, and repentance by another, by it ſelf: but by the ſame act and motion of the Spirit, by which the heart is drawne and turned upon God in beleeving, it is likewiſe drawne off, and turned aſide from ſinne in Repenting. Hence it is that the Scriptures ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſpeake of theſe two, Repenting and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60349:197"/> as ſuppoſing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one the other, and make the ſame promiſes of grace and forgiveneſſe of ſins indifferently to both: as might be ſhewed at large, if it were ſo proper or pertinent to this place. That which is called re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the receiving of the Word. verſe 41. and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, verſe 44. And as <hi>Peter</hi> in the place cited (<hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38.) requires Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in the <hi>Jewes,</hi> to qualifie and fit them for Baptiſme: So doth <hi>Philip</hi> require Faith or belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, in the Eunuch. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37. which ſhewes, that there is a very neere affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

Beſides divers other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of like current and importance.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding though (as hath been in effect already ſaid) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and beleeving or depending on God, be but one and the ſame motion of the ſoul, as a mans going from London to York, is but one and the ſame journey: yet may beleeving or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on God be ſaid to be before Repenting, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60349:198"/> of nature, and al ſo the cauſe of it, becauſe the ſoule is not occaſioned, moved, or perſwaded to beleeve on God, by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away from ſin: but on the contrary, is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and drawne aſide from ſin, by beleeving on God: as though a mans going from London to York be one and the ſame motion or journey, yet is his going to York, and his buſineſſe there, the cauſe of his going from London, and not his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from London, the cauſe of his going to Yorke.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60349:198"/> the cauſe of his willingnes to turn away from ſinne: but on the contrary, his willingneſſe of turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from ſin, is not the cauſe or means of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to enjoy God by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. As for that paſſage of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 32. which is alledged by ſome, to prove Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before Faith, as a cauſe or means of it, where he layes it to the charge of the chiefe Prieſts and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that when they had ſeen it, that is, that the Publicanes and Harlots had beleeved <hi>John</hi> in his Miniſtery, yet they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not afterwards, that they might beleeve: the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60349:199"/> meaning is not, that either the Publicans and harlots firſt repented of their ſins, and then afterwards belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>John,</hi> and that their Prieſts and Elders are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for not doing the like: but the ſenſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of our Saviours reproofe in this place, ſeems only this, that their perverſeneſſe and obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in the way of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief was ſuch, that the examples of Publicans and harlots before their eyes, who beleeved on him, and repented of their ſins, upon the preaching of <hi>John,</hi> wrought not at all upon them; they ſtill hardned themſelves in the ſinne of their unbeliefe,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60349:199"/> and had no relenting in them, no inclinations or deſires at all to beleeve. So that the Repentance here ſpoken of, which ſeems to goe before, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and diſpoſe toward a full, perfect and complete beleeving, is not that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and ſolemne Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by which the heart is taken off, and ſtands at a diſtance from all ſinne (indefinitely) but onely notes the firſt relentings, breakings, or yeeldings of the heart and ſoul, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpeciall ſinne of unbelief, but not as yet fully conceived or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to be a ſinne, but as ſuch an eſtate or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoule, whereof a

                  <p>This expoſition might be further opened and confirmed, as well by the context and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the place, as by the agreement and ſympathie of other Scriptures; but that now we neither have

                  <p n="19">19. The ſum then of all that we have reaſoned and laid down in this fourth member of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, comes to this: that how ſinfull, vile, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſoever a man hath been, or yet is, hee is not therefore bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to deferre or put off his beleeving or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on God, till he hath repented of, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken all his ſins: no, but whenſoever the golden ſcepter of grace and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation in Chriſt is held out unto him, though it be whilſt he is yet in the midſt of his iniquities,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60349:201"/> he ought without any more adoe (eſpecially, when hee findes his heart touched from heaven, and any deſires working in him that way) to leap and ſpring (as it were) into thoſe everlaſting armes of the mercy and faithfulnes of God, which are ever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to embrace and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine all thoſe that caſt themſelves into them, how unworthy ſoever they were, the very next moment before they came there. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
                  <p n="20">20. In the fifth place (to draw towards a concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant buſineſſe) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it was layed in, in the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60349:201"/> objection, that wicked men are diſcouraged from expecting any good from God, by thoſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings that are ſo ſeverely bent againſt them; to this I anſwere, that all threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings whatſoever, that are gone out of the mouth of God againſt ſinfull and wicked men, have no longer power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, then they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their unbeliefe. Their power this way is ſomewhat like that power of cenſure and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication that was given <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning which, he ſpeaks thus. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. We can doe nothing (by any power given us) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth, but for
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60349:202"/> the truth: as if he ſhould ſay, whilſt you walke or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, &amp; as beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the Goſpel of Chriſt (which is the Word of truth) I have no power, to judge, cenſure, or caſt you out: but onely when you ſinne againſt the Goſpel, and are a ſhame and reproach unto it: then indeed I have a power to ſtand up for the honour of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and to judge and cenſure, according to the nature of your ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding (as it followeth) hee was glad, when he was weak, and they ſtrong, that is, when their lives and ways were ſuch, that he could exerciſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60349:202"/> no more power over, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, then as if he had none at all given him. Such is the power that Scripture threatnings have againſt wicked men: they have no power neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth, but for the truth: whilſt men goe on in the contempt of the Goſpel, and deſpiſe that great ſalvation which is tendered unto them in Jeſus Chriſt, theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings have power to judge, cenſure, and to burne with unquenchable fire, to ſet men with fears and terrours, as in the midſt of hell: but yet they are glad alſo, when they are weak, and men are ſtrong, that is, when
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60349:203"/> men turn unto God by a true Faith, and ſound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, in which caſe their power ceaſeth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe they judge or condemn them any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. So that now ſuch threatnings, are no grounds at all of diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to wicked men from beleeving or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on God, no more then the power of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſword we ſpake of, that was given to <hi>Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, for cutting off from Chriſt, was a ground of diſcouragement to thoſe Chriſtians that walked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately, from return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to wayes of holineſſe, before the ſtroke of it
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60349:203"/> came. Nay, as this power in the Apoſtles, was ſo far from being a diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſuch men, from walking anſwerably to the Goſpel, that it was a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial encouragement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: in as much as by reaſon thereof, they had this recompence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward added unto their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and repentance, that they eſcaped the edge of that ſword, which wounded the ſouls of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: ſo the threatnings we ſpeak of, that are made out againſt wicked men in the Scriptures, are in this reſpect, rather matter of incouragement then diſcourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t unto them, for beleeving on God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60349:204"/> they doe increaſe the reward of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, by this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable addition; they ſhall be delivered thereby out of the danger of thoſe threatnings, which will doe terrible execution upon others, that ſhall perſiſt in their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Nay (to goe yet one ſtep further) the threatnings we have now under conſideration, are not onely matter of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to wicked men, to move them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and depend on God, but (that which is much more) they impoſe the greateſt, the deepeſt, the moſt abſolute and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60349:204"/> peremptory neceſſitie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, for beleeving. They certifie the ſoules and conſciences of men, that there is (as we uſe to ſay) no way with them but one, nothing but the vengeance of eternall fire to be looked for, except they beleeve. We have a ſaying: <hi>Ingens telum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitas:</hi> neceſſitie is a great weapon, and will put men upon, and ſtrengthen men to atchieve and performe many great enterpriſes &amp; actions, which without ſuch an advantage, they neither would have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured upon, nor had they been able to have effected and brought to paſſe.</p>

                  <p>And I make no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that the terrour of the threatnings of God, and the dreadfull and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt neceſſitie they lay upon men to provide for the things of their peace, have contributed and conduced much to the Faith (and conſequently to the ſalvation) of many whoſe reſt is now glorious in the Heavens. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (doubtleſſe) the threatnings of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt wicked perſons, rightly apprehended and conſidered, are no waies hinderances or diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto ſuch men, from or about beleeving or depending on God.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. But in the ſixt and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60349:205"/> laſt place (to finiſh all with the addition of a few words more) to that branch of the objection, wherein the hope, truſt and dependence of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men on God, were ſaid to be rejected by God, from whence it was argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and concluded, that ſuch had no right to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve or depend on God, and that it was in vaine for them to doe it; to this (I ſay) I anſwer, that though there be a kinde of truſt and dependence on God, which men may have, and yet miſcarry and be rejected (as was granted before) yet is there a truſt and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on God alſo, which
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60349:206"/> will ſecure the greateſt ſinner under Heaven from Death and Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it bee found with him: As though <hi>Simon Magus</hi> beleeved, and yet was in the gall of bitternes and bands of iniquity notwithſtanding, and ſo though <hi>Judas</hi> repented, and went to Hell: yet <hi>Thomas</hi> beleeving, and <hi>Simon Peter</hi> repenting (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thouſands more with them) were both ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For we may diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Faiths, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendences on God, in reſpect of their ends, or iſſues whereunto they tend, much after the ſame manner, as <hi>John</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth of ſinne, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:60349:206"/> 5. 16, 17. There is a ſinne (ſaith he) unto death, and there is a ſinne not unto death. So may we ſay of Faiths, and dependings on God: there is a Faith and dependence which is unto life, and there is a Faith and dependence too which is not unto life; and if the Faith of wicked men be of this kind, it is no marvell, if their faith and they periſh together, and be both alike rejected by God. That Faith which is required of men, being yet in their ſinnes, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of darknes, which therefore they have a ſufficient right unto (as hath been already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) did they addreſſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60349:207"/> themſelves unto God with it, this would ſtrike that great ſtroke for their ſouls, this would make them heires of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall and undefiled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be rejected by God: This is that faith or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, which in the act or exerciſe of it, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth God: and of this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we have treated in our doctrine hitherto.</p>
                  <p>Againe, there is a Faith, which rather unſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, polluteth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneth God, when it is acted upon him: and it is no marvell, if ſuch a faith be not able to ſave a man (as <hi>James</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.)</p>
                  <p n="23">
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:60349:207"/>23. It were unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable altogether (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) upon this occaſion only, to enter upon a juſt diſcuſſion or examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: wee have ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (I truſt) made good the tenor and ſubſtance of the motive propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to quicken and ſtirre you up (and withall to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you to depend upon God) againſt thoſe intanglements and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of feare, that were preſented unto you in the objection, and have built you cleerely and ſtrongly upon this foundation, that there is nothing in God, neither holineſſe of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60349:208"/> nature, nor righteouſneſſe of works, nor greatneſſe of Majeſtie, nor yet any thing in your ſelf, neither ſinfulneſſe of nature, nor ſinfulneſſe of life, nor any weakneſſe or unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe whatſoever cleaving to you, that conſidering the golden ſcepter of Grace, held out unto you in the Goſpel, with ſo much freeneſſe, and love, and mercy powred out, needs be the leaſt diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement or weakning of hand unto you, from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your dependence, whole and intire, ſtrong and glorious, upon God. And this was the ſumme of our undertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="24">
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:60349:208"/>24. Notwithſtanding to ſalve the longing (it may be) of your deſires in a point of this weight, and neere concernment as well to the preſent, as future peace of your ſouls, only untill you come at ſome full fountaine of theſe waters, where you may quench your thirſt throughly, I ſhall be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give you a taſte of one maine difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that kinde of Faith and dependence on God, which will open the doore, and lead you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this bleſſed Sanctuary here promiſed, and that which will leave you without, naked, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the wrath of God
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60349:209"/> in every kind. That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on God, which is raiſed in the ſoule by the help or means of that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of God, or of the minde and counſells of God, which is within a man, is a dependence which God will reject, and with which the creature may periſh: as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that which either ſprings out of a true light of the knowledge of God, or is accompanied and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended (as it were) in the production or birth of it, with ſuch knowledge, is that great and ſacred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, which inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Almightie to his creature, and carrieth Heaven and Salvation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:60349:209"/>
                  <p>This difference is built upon the ſure foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Scriptures. <hi>This is life eternall</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, to his Father, in that ſolemne Prayer of his, a little before his death, <hi>Joh. 17. 3.) That they know thee, the only true God, and him whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt. This is life eternall,</hi> that is, a certain means of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalvation, or life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: it is a figurative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion (very frequent in Scripture) wherein the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is put for the cauſe or means of ſuch an effect: as <hi>Deut. 13. 5. Becauſe he hath ſpoken apoſtacie or revolt,</hi> (ſo it is in the originall) that is, becauſe hee hath
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60349:210"/> ſpoken that which may be a cauſe or means of your revolting from God. So <hi>John 3. 19. This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, &amp;c.</hi> that is, the means of the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So againe: <hi>Rom. 14. 20. Deſtroy not the worke of God,</hi> that is, take not a courſe, uſe not the means to deſtroy him. In this figure of ſpeech, Chriſt is called our peace, that is, the Author or means of our peace, <hi>Ephe. 2. 14. The reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Joh. 11. 25. The Lord our righteouſneſſe. Jere.</hi> 23. 6. that is, the Author or cauſe of our riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and of our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe (or juſtification) beſides many like expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60349:210"/> Now then if the true knowledge of God, and of Chriſt (for the one cannot be knowne aright without the other) be an unqueſtionable means of eternall life, it muſt be this means, thus, as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth and worketh a true and living Faith in men; according to that which <hi>David</hi> affirmeth, <hi>Pſal. 9. 10. They that know thy Name, will truſt in thee.</hi> Becauſe without ſuch a Faith, or truſting in God, eternall life is not to be had, or obtained. <hi>Marke 16. 16, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore that faith or dependence on God, which ariſeth from ſuch a knowledge, muſt needs be the true
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60349:211"/> Faith, which is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the favour of God, and with ſalvation: otherwiſe ſuch knowledge could not be the means of either, inaſmuch as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to be enjoyed without ſuch a Faith.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. And for thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and examples (ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Scriptures) of ſome mens relyings and truſtings on God, without acceptation, as <hi>Pſal. 18. 41. 42. Matth. 7. 22. 26. &amp;c.</hi> It were eaſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that they were aſſiſted and ſtrengthened in their raiſing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, by the ignorance of God found in the hearts of thoſe, who are ſaid ſo to have relyed or
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60349:211"/> truſted on him. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that thoſe ſpoken of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. who were there rejected in their prayer, and conſequently in their dependence (ſuch as it was) on God, were men deſtitute of the true knowledge of God. For they are ſaid, verſe 40. to have hated <hi>David,</hi> a dear childe, and faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God. Now the Scripture teacheth expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that he that hateth his brother, is in darkneſſe, and walketh in darkneſſe, 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 11. that is, is in a worſe condition then he thinks, or is aware of, and knoweth not how to doe any thing, to perform any work or ſervice in a holy
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60349:212"/> and right manner, as hee ought.</p>
                  <p>And again. 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 8. He that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love,</hi> that is, God truly known, alwayes fills the heart with love towards men. So for thoſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. whoſe ſoules miſcarried under a kinde of hope, or truſting and relying upon God or Chriſt, as apparent it is, that neither had theſe any right knowledge, nor due apprehenſions of either. Becauſe it is ſaid, that they were workers of iniquitie, verſe 23. and that they heard the words of Chriſt, and did them not, verſe 26. that is, they lived in knowne ſinnes. Now
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60349:212"/> concerning ſuch, the Scripture alſo ſpeaketh plainly, That whoſoever ſinneth (willingly, and againſt light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) hath not ſeen him (that is, God) neither hath knowne him, that is, hath not had ſo much as a cleer ſight or enterview of him, much leſſe any ſetled, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found knowledge of him. The ſight of a man (wee know) is but the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the knowledge of him.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. So that the rule is univerſally true, that that Faith or dependence on God, which either ariſeth out of a true knowledge of him, or is accompanied
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60349:213"/> with ſuch knowledge in its ariſing, alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers, &amp; triumpheth in its acceptation: as on the contrary, when men will claime friendſhip and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God, and will needs depend upon him for favour, out of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and fond imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and perſwaſions of him, ſuch claimes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendences are ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and caſt out by him. The reaſon hereof may well be that which the Apoſtle delivers, and laies down, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. as a ground or principle, upon w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> God builds many other of the wayes of his providence and diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the world: <hi>If the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60349:213"/> root be holy, ſo are the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> As on the other hand <hi>Job</hi> reaſoneth, and demandeth, <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean? Job.</hi> 14. So if the root of our dependence on God be holy, that is, if this dependence ſprings and ſhoots (as it were) out of righteous thoughts and apprehenſions of God, and of Chriſt, it cannot but be holy, &amp; ſo accepted with him. As on the contrary, if it be any common, unclean, or polluted conceit or noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, that gives the raiſe and advantage to our truſt, or be the baſis and bottome of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on him, it is no
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60349:214"/> marvell if ſuch truſt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence be profaned by him, and rejected with diſdaine and indignation. As for example: the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of whom <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 16. is ſaid, verſe 21. to have this conceit or thought of God, that hee is altogether ſuch an one as himſelf, that is, that he likes and approves thoſe wayes and practiſes of ſin, wherein hee was ingaged and hardened, as well as himſelf did. Now if ſuch a thought or opinion of God, as this, that hee ſhould approve of, or any wayes comply with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the evill of their ways, be the reaſon or ground, or els gives any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60349:214"/> &amp; furtherance to our hope and dependence upon him for favour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection or deliverance in any kinde, how can the light of reaſon it ſelfe in a man, judge or conceive any other, but that ſuch hope or dependence ſhould rather turne to the ſhame and confuſion of him that comes unto the Lord with them, then finde the leaſt grace or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with him?</p>
                  <p n="27">27. This (doubtleſſe) is the caſe of ſuch Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and profeſſours in the Church, as our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents (<hi>Matt.</hi> 7. 26.) in his parable or ſimilitude of the fooliſh builder, that built upon the ſands.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60349:215"/> 
                     <hi>He that heareth my words, and doth them not, ſhall be likened unto a fooliſh buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which built his houſe upon the ſand, &amp;c.</hi> That hope or expectation of ſalvation, or favour from God, which all men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, profeſſing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, take unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more or leſſe, is compared to a houſe wherein a man dwells: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as ſuch a houſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects and defends a man from the injuries of the weather, as cold, winde, raine, ſnow, &amp;c. beſides many other inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be offenſive to his health, and peace, and might endanger his life it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60349:215"/> ſelf, ſo that no man would willingly be in the world without a houſe over his head, and he thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf poor and miſerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that hath none: ſo doth the hope of finding favour with God, and of obtaining ſalvation by Chriſt, arme and fence the ſouls and conſciences of men, from the ſpiritual annoyances and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of their ſins, and of the wrath of God due unto them: they were not able with any tolerable peace or comfort of their lives, to beare the fiery and terrible aſſaults and incurſions of the feares of hell and damnation, which would ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60349:216"/> be breaking in upon them, had they not ſome hope of ſalvation, to guard and fence their conſciences withal. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity lying upon all men, to build themſelves ſuch ſpirituall houſes as theſe, that is, to raiſe ſome hope &amp; dependence on God, in themſelves: becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their conſciences would be too hot for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and their ſinnes, and hell, and the wrath of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, would torment them before their time, and give them no reſt, neither night nor day. But (ſaith our Saviour, in effect) as he ſhould ſhew himſelfe a very weake and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60349:216"/> fooliſh man, that could build himſelfe a materiall houſe to dwell in, upon the ſand, which is a looſe matter, and no wayes likely to beare the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a building, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when ſtreſſe of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comes, when boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous windes, raging raines, ſwelling floods, ſhould at once aſſault it: So is that man very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in his generation, that builds any hope or dependence on God for protection or deliverance in any kinde, upon any ſuch opinion and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of him, that he ſhould tolerate and connive at, or any wayes approve or countenance ſuch as ſhall
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60349:217"/> deſpiſe the words of my mouth, that ſhall onely give me the hearing of my righteous Lawes and Commandements in the Goſpel, and caſt them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their backs, when they have done, and walk on their owne wayes not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding: and yet (ſaith he) there is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men that will doe it, that will build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe ſpirituall ſands, theſe waſhie, looſe, and ungrounded conceits and apprehenſions of God.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. So againe, if the root of a mans hope or dependence on God for life and ſalvation, ſhall be any ſuch opinion of him as this, that he will ſet my
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60349:217"/> good workes againſt my evill, my righteouſneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my fin, and for the merit of the one, will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the demerit of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or that he will juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me, or accept of me in any other way, or by any other means, then in, and by, and through Jeſus Chriſt alone, this root be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rottenneſſe, the bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of it (my hope or dependence on God) ſhall mount up as duſt before the winde (to allude to the Prophets expreſſion. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 5. 24.) that is, ſhall vaniſh and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. To depend upon God upon any lying and falſe apprehenſions of him, is as if a riotous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60349:218"/> and drunken com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, being in danger of the laws for ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour or other, ſhould come to a great man, of a grave, ſober, and religious courſe of life, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner: Sir, I know you are a freind of good fellows, and wiſh well to thoſe that will be free and merry among their cups: I pray ſtand my friend in ſuch a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: I depend upon your help and countenance, to be brought off from my trouble, without much loſſe or ſhame, &amp;c. Would not ſuch a motion, and pretended truſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, be interpreted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as an abuſe, or a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60349:218"/> to ſuch a man, and conſequently be utterly rejected by him? ſo what conceit or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion ſoever it is, that any man ſhall take unto himſelfe concerning God, otherwiſe then according to truth, and what God hath revealed of himſelf in his word and works; and ſhall ſtrengthen and encourage his ſoul there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſtay himſelf, or to depend upon him, ſhall rather profane that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and fearefull Name, the Lord his God, then any wayes honour, or ſanctifie it, by ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, his dependence and he are like to periſh
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60349:219"/> together. For there is no thought or apprehenſion that can be framed and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned in the minde of a man concerning God, but will be a prophanation of him, excepting only thoſe that anſwere the truth of his nature and beeing, there being nothing wanting in him, but that which is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of him.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. If you be yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, and aſke yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how you may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and cleerly know, whether your hope and dependence on God, be built upon the right foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and righteous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of God, or
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60349:219"/> whether they be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſandy and deceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thoughts of thine owne heart, concerning him: To this I anſwere, in a word (and ſo an end of this buſineſſe:) If thy hope, truſt, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on God, be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this rock, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in Chriſt, that is, a ſetled, inward and unfained perſwaſion or apprehenſion of God, that he will for his Sonne Chriſts ſake alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mediation of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration, qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, preparation or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive whatſoever, nay, and againſt the mediation of any conſideration, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, preparation or
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60349:220"/> motive whatſoever, for deſtruction and death, will imbrace with his love, and conferre life and ſalvation upon all thoſe without exception and partialitie, that ſhall truſt in him, or depend upon him through Chriſt, ſuch hope, truſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, are moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably built upon the beſt and ſureſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations under heaven, and if they knew their owne ſtrength, might laugh at all the tempeſts, troubles and turmoyles of the world, yea, the gates of hell, and all the powers of darkneſſe in the face to ſcorne.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. It is true, hope
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60349:220"/> and dependence upon God may (I conceive) be lawfully &amp; ſafely built upon other foundations then this, I meane upon ſome other veine, or ſtream of this knowledge of God in Chriſt (beſides this maine and maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtream deſcribed) if men be of a ſpirituall dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and exactneſſe, to make due application of ſuch knowledge, upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. As for example: if a man hath the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his own conſcience, witneſſing unto him in the holy Ghoſt, that he hath for any ſpace of time walked before God, with all faithfulneſſe and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe of heart, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60349:221"/> hypocriſy, this (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) is a ſufficient and lawfull foundation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to raiſe a hope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon God for ſalvation, I meane for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt, and for his ſake, not for the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies ſake, nor faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſake, or the like: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath promiſed ſalvation to ſuch, I mean to thoſe that walk before him in wayes of faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, integritie, &amp;c. and (no queſtion) God may be ſafely depended upon for whatſoever he promiſeth, according to the termes and conditions of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. So, for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if a man truely loves God, or the brethren (as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60349:221"/> the ſcripture ſpeaketh) he may hereupon lawfully and ſafely depend upon God for ſalvation, becauſe God hath eſtabliſhed both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for ſignes thereof.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. Again, if I depend upon God for ſalvation upon this ground, becauſe I am verily perſwaded that God will ſave me in particular, if through Chriſt I come unto him, or depend upon him for it, I make little queſtion but ſuch a dependence alſo will ſtand before God, and draw heaven after it, becauſe the foundation of it is agreeable to the word of truth. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are two maine
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60349:222"/> differences (beſides, it may be, many others) between theſe, and ſuch like bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or leſſer ſtreams of the knowledge of God in Chriſt, and that body (as it were) or maine ſtream thereof, lately mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in reſpect of advantage and commodiouſneſſe, to raiſe our hope or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on God upon. Firſt, a man can very hardly (if at all) come at any of theſe particular branches of this knowledge, to make foundations of them, of his truſt or dependence upon God, except he firſt layeth hold on the maine body it ſelf. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: he can hardly beleeve, that either the teſtimony
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60349:222"/> of his conſcience, witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto him his faithfull and upright walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, or that his love of God and of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrren, or that a perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his owne ſalvation by Chriſt in particular, or the like, can be any ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient grounds for him, to depend upon God for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, except he firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves &amp; be eſtabliſhed in this main truth, that God for his Sonne Chriſts ſake, without any other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whatſoever, yea and againſt any other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſineration whatſoever, will give life and ſalvation to all thoſe without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that through Chriſt ſhall truſt in him.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60349:223"/> He that ſticks or ſtaggers about the receiving or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving of this truth, doubtleſſe can never be throughly grounded, or ſtrongly built upon thoſe other: becauſe theſe are as branches ſhooting out of that main ſtock, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereon, ſubordinate and ſubſervient thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Whereby it is evident, that a man may raiſe a true hope &amp; dependence on God for ſalvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can come at any of thoſe inferiour grounds mentioned to build upon, as either the teſtimony of his conſcience touching his faithfulneſſe and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe before God, or a ſenſe of his unfained
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60349:223"/> love to God or men, or a perſwaſion of his perſonal ſalvation, &amp;c. namely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this great foundation of truth, That whoſoever through Chriſt ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on God, ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (which is before a man at all times.) And is it not wiſedom to take the firſt opportunitie we can come at, to build our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendences upon God?</p>
                  <p n="32">32. But ſecondly, a more materiall and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable difference is, that thoſe inferiour and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate grounds wee ſpake of, as the conſcience of our uprightneſſe, ſenſe of our love, perſwaſion of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſalvation, and the like (upon which eſpecially, if
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60349:224"/> not onely, moſt men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as it were, in the fire, to build and ſettle their hope and dependence on God for ſalvation) are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to be diſtinctly, cleerly, and ſatisfyingly diſcerned and judged of: they are very few that can or dare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude with any confidence, that their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe is an uprightnes of that kind of perfection, which God hath ſealed for an infallible pledge or ſign of ſalvation to enſue. And ſo for the love of God, and of the children of God: how rare a thing is it, to finde either a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſo fully ſatisfied touching the truth of ſuch an affection in themſelves,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60349:224"/> that they are able to build upon it a quiet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed hope of ſalvation? And even of thoſe that ſeem to build with moſt peace and confidence this way; are there not ſome ſuſpected (and that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not without juſt cauſe) by others? And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why theſe and ſuch like grounds of hope, and depending upon God, are ſo tickle &amp; ſlippery, ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to jealouſies, doubtings and fears, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though the rule be as certainly true here, as in the other (it being eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whit as true, that hee that is upright before God, or that truely loves God, ſhall be ſaved, as it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60349:225"/> is, that hee ſhall be ſaved, who truly beleeves, that God for Chriſts ſake will ſave all thoſe, that by him come unto him) yet the application of it is much more difficult and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. And the reaſon of this is: becauſe to the due application of ſuch rules (without which no hope, or dependence on God can with ſafety be built upon them) there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a cleere and ſatisfying knowledge of more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars (yea, and of ſome things more intricate and obſcure) then is to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of that other. As for example; Before I can build any ſetled and ſtedy dependence upon God
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60349:225"/> for ſalvation, upon this ground (or rule) <hi>that I truly love the Brethren</hi> (that is, the Saints and ſervants of God) I muſt be cleerly reſolved, and ſecured in my ſelfe, touching theſe 3. things; Firſt, that this is the undoubted Word and Truth of God, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deceive me, <hi>That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever loveth the Brethren, ſhall be ſaved;</hi> Secondly, I muſt be ſecured in my ſelf, that my beleefe of this truth, as being the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted word of God, is ſound &amp; ſtrong, and ſuch as cannot be ſhaken; Thirdly, I muſt likewiſe be cleer and fully ſatisfied in my ſelf, that my love to the Brethren is true, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60349:226"/> natural, and of that very kind (&amp; none other) which God hath ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for an evidence and ſeal of ſalvation, wherein how difficult a thing it is (even above meaſure) to gaine any ſuch ſatisfaction, ſo cleere and abſolute, but that the conſcience will repine &amp; mutter at (more or leſſe) hath been already intimated, and from the experience of more then many thouſands, may be concluded. And yet if I be wavering or doubtfull in any of theſe particulars, I cannot build upon this ground, with any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or peace. But to build upon that maine ground mentioned, <hi>that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60349:226"/> whoſoever beleeves in God through Chriſt, ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> (and that with the richeſt and deepeſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) ſatisfaction in theſe two things only will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſuffice. Firſt, that this is the unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable truth of God, <hi>that whoſoever beleeves in him through Chriſt, ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> Secondly, that my knowledge or beleef of this truth accordingly, is ſubſtantiall and ſound. He that hath a well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſecuritie in himſelfe touching theſe two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars onely, may ſafely build unto himſelf a hope and dependence upon God, for ſalvation. For what ſhould hinder him?
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60349:227"/> or whereof can hee be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid? Hee that certainly knows, that a man is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied (and conſequently ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Jeſus Chriſt, that he may be juſtified (and ſo ſaved) <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. Neither can he (at leaſt with any reaſon) doubt more of his beleeving, then of his knowledge: nor of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification (or ſalvation) more, then of either. So that without controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, the great and maine promiſe of the Goſpel, that whoſoever beleeves on Jeſus Chriſt (or on God through Chriſt) ſhall be ſaved, is both a readier and cleerer, and a more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60349:227"/> foundation for any man that ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the juſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance thereof, to build his hope or dependence on God for ſalvation, then any other ground or foundation whatſoever. But this is a point where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have inlarged my ſelf unto you otherwiſe: and willing I am, to diſcharge both you and my ſelf, you from hearing, and my ſelf from ſpeaking more of this ſubject for the preſent, upon the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of thoſe medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
